 abstract = {An approach to sample size planning for multiple regression is presented that emphasizes accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE). The AIPE approach yields precise estimates of population parameters by providing necessary sample sizes in order for the likely widths of confidence intervals to be sufficiently narrow. One AIPE method yields a sample size such that the expected width of the confidence interval around the standardized population regression coefficient is equal to the width specified. An enhanced formulation ensures, with some stipulated probability, that the width of the confidence interval will be no larger than the width specified. Issues involving standardized regression coefficients and random predictors are discussed, as are the philosophical differences between AIPE and the power analytic approaches to sample size planning.},

@article{Krakowski.2003,
 abstract = {There has been much interest in the role of serotonin in aggressive behavior during the past two decades, but no simple one-to-one causal relationship has been found between this biological variable and aggression. The influence of serotonin is best analyzed within a broader framework that includes consideration of its role in the inhibition of impulses, the regulation of emotions and social functioning, domains that are closely linked to aggression. Impulsivity and strong emotional states often accompany violent acts. Aggressive individuals are likely to experience general difficulties with impulse control and emotional regulation, and they show impaired social cognition and affiliation. Serotonergic dysfunction will influence aggression differently, depending on the individual's impulse control, emotional regulation, and social abilities. Yet, aggressive acts occur in a broader social context. As such, serotonergic function has an effect not only on the individual but also on the group dynamics, and it is in turn influenced by these dynamics. Whether aggression will occur when serotonin dysfunction is present will depend on individual differences as well as the overall social context.



There has been a great deal of interest concerning the role of central nervous system (CNS) serotonin in aggression. Findings in various areas, including human and animal studies, pharmacological, imaging, and receptor subtyping research indicate the importance of serotonin in certain types of aggressive behaviors. The literature reviewed in this article is pertinent in understanding the relationship between serotonin and aggressive behavior in the context of three important domains related to aggression, namely impulse control, affect regulation, and social functioning.



Extensive literature dating back to the 1960s provides evidence of an association between animal aggression and reduced serotonergic function. Beginning in the late 1970s, studies focused on human aggression, examining violence toward others as well as suicide, which was viewed as a form of violence, i.e., self-directed violence. Serotonergic function was a marker and predictor of both violence and suicide in various populations. However, not all aggressive behaviors were associated with decreased serotonin function and this association needed further characterization. These aggressive behaviors were often maladaptive in some ways, whether impulsive, emotionally driven, or socially dysfunctional. Impulse control, emotional regulation, and social functioning appear to be important qualifiers of the violent behavior associated with serotonin dysfunction. They also serve to characterize further the overall functioning of the violent individuals whose difficulties are rarely limited to aggression alone.



Of these three areas, impulsivity has received the most attention. Serotonin is seen as playing a role in the inhibition of impulses other than aggressive ones. Researchers have investigated the relationship of serotonin to various impulsive behaviors and to {\textquotedbl}impulsivity{\textquotedbl} as a trait. The regulation of emotions is relevant to both violence and impulse control. Strong emotional states often accompany violent acts that are considered impulsive. Irritability, temper outbursts, or a greater emotional responsiveness to others are often present in violent or impulsive individuals. Many of these individuals have general problems with emotional self-regulation.



Social functioning is linked to violence in many ways. An aggressive individual is more likely to show various social problems, including impaired social cognition and social affiliation. Dysfunctional aggressive behavior can be viewed as representing one extreme along a continuum of social interactions; the opposite pole consisting of skilled affiliative behaviors and social cooperativeness. However, it is important not to limit the analysis to the person's social characteristics. Aggressive acts occur in a social context. The same characteristics can lead to dissimilar behavioral outcomes, depending on the attributes of other group members. The channeling of impulses and emotions are expressed in a social context and are the products of social interactions. Viewed in this fashion, aggression is a complex phenomenon that must be analyzed at the biological, psychological, and social levels of organization. Basic structures and processes at one level help define the other levels.},

 abstract = {The editorial policies of several prominent educational and psychological journals require that researchers report some measure of effect size along with tests for statistical significance. In analysis of variance contexts, this requirement might be met by using eta squared or omega squared statistics. Current procedures for computing these measures of effect often do not consider the effect that design features of the study have on the size of these statistics. Because research-design features can have a large effect on the estimated proportion of explained variance, the use of partial eta or omega squared can be misleading. The present article provides formulas for computing generalized eta and omega squared statistics, which provide estimates of effect size that are comparable across a variety of research designs.},

The authors develop and propose a conceptual framework to illustrate that salience of haptic information differs significantly across products, consumers, and situations. The authors use two experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products. In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information. The authors synthesize the results of these studies and discuss implications for the effect of haptic information for Internet and other nonstore retailing as well as for traditional retailers.},

@article{Dhar.2003,
 abstract = {Whereas most academic and industry studies of consumer preferences and decision making involve forced choice (i.e., participants are told to choose one of the presented product or service alternatives), buyers usually also have the option not to select any alternative. An implicit assumption in the experimental practice of forcing choice is that the no-choice option draws proportionately from the various available alternatives, such that the qualitative conclusions are unaffected. However, the authors propose that the no-choice option competes most directly with alternatives that buyers tend to select when they are uncertain about their preferences. Building on this general proposition, the authors show that the introduction of the no-choice option strengthens the attraction effect, weakens the compromise effect, and decreases the relative share of an option that is {\textquotedbl}average{\textquotedbl} on all dimensions. They also examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of having the option not to choose and the conditions under which the no-choice option is likely to affect relative option shares. The results are consistent with the notion that the no-choice option provides an alternative way of resolving difficult choices that is not available when subjects are forced to choose. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.},

 abstract = {Lines of Coffea arabica derived from the Timor Hybrid (hybrid between C. arabica and C. canephora) are resistant to coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) and to the nematode Meloidogyne exigua. The introgression of C. canephora resistance genes is suspected of causing a drop in beverage quality. Coffee samples from pure lines, compared in a Trial 1, and from F1 hybrids and parental lines from a half-diallel trial in a Trial 2, were studied for beverage quality, chemical composition and amount of introgressed genetic material. Chemical analyses (caffeine, chlorogenic acids, fat, trigonelline, sucrose) were carried out with near-infrared spectrometry by reflectance of green coffee. The number of amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers introgressed from the Timor Hybrid varied from 1 to 37 for the lines studied. There were significant differences between lines for all of the biochemical compounds analysed and for the acidity and the overall standard of the beverage. Two lines (T17927, T17924) were significantly poorer than the controls for sucrose and beverage acidity. T17924 also had more chlorogenic acids and was poorer for the overall standard. However, two highly introgressed lines, T17934 and T17931 (25 and 30 AFLP markers, respectively), did not differ from the non-introgressed controls. There were no correlations between the number of AFLP markers and the chemical contents or beverage attributes. Significant correlations were found between the performance of the parents and their general combining ability for beverage quality. It was concluded that it should be possible to find lines with both the desired resistance genes and good beverage quality. Selection can avoid accompanying the introgression of resistance genes with a drop in beverage quality.},

Nogo trials were preceded by either 1, 3, or 5 go trials and then compared to one another. Two distinct patterns of activation were associated with behavioral inhibition: First, the ventral prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and superior parietal regions showed a context effect with an increase in MR signal to nogo trials with increasing number of preceding go trials. Second, anterior regions in the supplementary and premotor cortex showed an increase in MR signal on the nogo condition after 5 preceding go trials, but not after only 1 or 3. A model using the BOLD response in our data was used to verify that the effect of context was not an artifact of the randomization scheme used in the design.},

@article{Fehr.2002,
 abstract = {This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this behavioral propensity {\textquotedbl}strong reciprocity{\textquotedbl} and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.},

This book examines how, and how well, people answer such questions.  The study of human judgment was transformed in the 1970s when Kahneman and Tversky introduced their 'heuristics and biases' approach.  Their approach highlighted the reflexive mental operations that are used to make complex problems manageable, and it generated a torrent of influential research in psychology - research that reverberated widely and affected scholarship in economics, law, medicine, management, and political science.  This book compiles the most influential elements of psychological research in the heuristics and biases tradition.  The various contributions critically analyze the initial work on heuristics and biases, supplement these initial statements with emerging theory and empirical findings in psychology, and point to the most promising areas of future research on judgment.{\textquotedbl}--publisher description (LoC)},

I use the regulatory focus distinction between promotion focus concerns with aspirations and accomplishments and prevention focus concerns with safety and responsibilities (Higgins, 1997, 1998) to illustrate outcome value and value from fit. Justification of a decision is used to illustrate value from proper means. I propose that decision makers are unlikely to distinguish among their experiences of these 3 types of value, and thus value from fit and value from proper means can be transferred to outcome value. I present evidence of such value transfer and consider its implications for value to the customer.

 abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

Parducci, 1965). It is likely that factors that affect these representations in turn affect the psychological processes that rely on them. The authors conducted 4 experiments to investigate whether language-expressible magnitude comparisons distort mental representations of compared magnitudes. Participants compared magnitudes and estimated those magnitudes in a variety of tasks. Exp 1 through 3 demonstrated systematic comparison-induced distortions. Exp 4 demonstrated that comparison-induced distortions might account for the asymmetric dominance effect discussed in the decision-making literature. Potential effects of comparison-induced distortions on other psychological processes (e.g., density effects, order effects, body-size estimation, pain estimation, and consumer decision making) are discussed.

 abstract = {The paper discusses the use of latent variables in psychology and social science research. Local independence, expected value true scores, and nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an alternative {\textquotedbl}sample realizations{\textquotedbl} definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

This paper identifies and describes applications conducted during 1990-2000. From this basis some important areas for future research are reflected upon. These include: having a better understanding of how respondents interpret price, risk and time attributes; strengthening designs and analysis; investigating decision making heuristics employed when completing DCEs, and the extent these are related to the complexity of the task, external validity, reliability and generalisability. Collaborative work with statistical design experts, psychologists, sociologists and qualitative researchers will prove useful when investigating these issues. It is also critical to link, more generally, the research agenda to work being carried out in marketing, transport and environmental economics and health economics benefit assessment.},

@article{Schwappach.2003,
 abstract = {Using an experimental conjoint-analysis like approach, preferences for resource allocation were studied. An interactive survey was developed which was published in the World Wide Web. A convenience sample of undergraduate students participated in the study. Subjects were confronted with nine pairwise scenarios describing hypothetical patient groups in need of life-saving treatments. The patient groups presented differed in terms of their health-related lifestyle, socioeconomic status, age, life expectancy, quality of life after treatment and whether they had received extensive medical care in the past. Participants were asked to allocate a finite budget to each patient group. All attributes used in this study significantly influenced respondents' preferences on how to allocate the budget between patient groups. The general importance of attributes used in the QALY approach is supported by this study with quality of life being a central criterion. The distributional patterns observed were, however, different from those expected when rigorously adhering to the QALY framework: In only a very small fraction of allocations subjects distributed the entire budget strictly on the patient group expecting the highest QALY gain. The vast majority of responders was willing to trade efficiency for a more equal distribution of resources. The approach dsecribed can be used to analyze the importance people place on different attributes in resource allocation decisions and to study preferences for the final distribution of resources.

To determine whether parachutes are effective in preventing major trauma related to gravitational challenge.

DESIGN

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

DATA SOURCES

Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases; appropriate internet sites and citation lists.

STUDY SELECTION

Studies showing the effects of using a parachute during free fall.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

Death or major trauma, defined as an injury severity score {\textgreater} 15.

RESULTS

We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials of parachute intervention.

CONCLUSIONS

As with many interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effectiveness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation by using randomised controlled trials. Advocates of evidence based medicine have criticised the adoption of interventions evaluated by using only observational data. We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.},

@article{Toubia.2003,
 abstract = {We propose and test new adaptive question design and estimation algorithms for partialprofile

conjoint analysis. Polyhedral question design focuses questions to reduce a

feasible set of parameters as rapidly as possible. Analytic center estimation uses a centrality

criterion based on consistency with respondents' answers. Both algorithms run with no

noticeable delay between questions.

We evaluate the proposed methods relative to established benchmarks for question design

(random selection, D-efficient designs, adaptive conjoint analysis) and estimation (hierarchical

Bayes). Monte Carlo simulations vary respondent heterogeneity and response errors.

For low numbers of questions, polyhedral question design does best (or is tied for best)

for all tested domains. For high numbers of questions, efficient fixed designs do better in

some domains. Analytic center estimation shows promise for high heterogeneity and for low

response errors; hierarchical Bayes for low heterogeneity and high response errors. Other

simulations evaluate hybrid methods, which include self-explicated data.

A field test (330 respondents) compared methods on both internal validity (holdout tasks)

and external validity (actual choice of a laptop bag worth approximately {\$}100). The field test

is consistent with the simulation results and offers strong support for polyhedral question

design. In addition, marketplace sales were consistent with conjoint-analysis predictions.},

@article{Bateson.2002,
 abstract = {It is conventionally assumed that, when animals evaluate alternative options, the value assigned to an option is absolute and independent of the other options available. It follows that animal choices should exhibit the rational property of regularity whereby the proportion of choices for an option cannot be increased by the addition of further options to the choice set. However, violations of regularity occur in human decision making, suggesting that humans may use comparative evaluation mechanisms whereby the value of an option is computed relative to the other options available. For example, in the asymmetrically dominated decoy effect the preference for a target option over a competitor is altered by the addition of a decoy option that is inferior to the target and competitor on one attribute, but lies between them on a second. We tested whether foraging wild rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, would demonstrate violations of regularity in response to an asymmetrically dominated decoy. Sixteen birds chose between three artificial flower types (Target: 15 \textgreek{m}l, 40{\%} sucrose; Competitor: 45 \textgreek{m}l, 30{\%}; Decoy: 10 \textgreek{m}l, 35{\%}) in Binary (Target versus Competitor) and Trinary (Target versus Competitor versus Decoy) treatments. We predicted higher preference for the Target in the Trinary treatment. The birds ranked the three options in the same order in the Binary and Trinary treatments (Competitor{\textgreater}Target{\textgreater}Decoy). Seven birds showed violations of regularity, six increasing their absolute preference for the Competitor in the Trinary treatment. Overall, relative preference for the Competitor over the Target was higher in the Trinary than in the Binary treatment. These changes in preference are incompatible with an absolute evaluation mechanism.},

@article{Reichheld.2003,
 abstract = {Companies spend lots of time and money on complex tools to assess customer satisfaction. But they're measuring the wrong thing. The best predictor of top-line growth can usually be captured in a single survey question: Would you recommend this company to a friend? This finding is based on two years of research in which a variety of survey questions were tested by linking the responses with actual customer behavior--purchasing patterns and referrals--and ultimately with company growth. Surprisingly, the most effective question wasn't about customer satisfaction or even loyalty per se. In most of the industries studied, the percentage of customers enthusiastic enough about a company to refer it to a friend or colleague directly correlated with growth rates among competitors. Willingness to talk up a company or product to friends, family, and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty because of the customer's sacrifice in making the recommendation. When customers act as references, they do more than indicate they've received good economic value from a company; they put their own reputations on the line. And they will risk their reputations only if they feel intense loyalty. The findings point to a new, simpler approach to customer research, one directly linked to a company's results. By substituting a single question--blunt tool though it may appear to be--for the complex black box of the customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth.},

@article{King.2004,
 abstract = {Consumer acceptance of food and beverage was measured after modifying four key factors or `context effects' in five consumer central location tests: its function as a meal component, social interaction during consumption, the physical environment in which the food is selected and consumed, and food choice. One of two flavor variations each of salad, pizza and iced tea were served. Acceptance ratings and self-reported food intake were obtained from consumers. In Tests 1--5, context effects were added sequentially, so that by Test 5 all context effects were present. Sixth test served as a comparison to `real life' and took place at a local restaurant. Our hypothesis was that product acceptability would increase with the addition of the various context effects. Meal context had the strongest positive effect on tea; social context had a strong negative effect on pizza; environment had a weak but positive effect on pizza and tea and a negative effect on salad; and choice had a positive effect on salad. These results suggest that context variables do affect product acceptance, but that the relationship between context effect and consumer acceptance may not be consistent within and across meal components.},

@article{Kivetz.2004,
 abstract = {The compromise effect denotes the finding that brands gain share

when they become the intermediate rather than extreme option in a

choice set. Despite the robustness and importance of this phenomenon,

choice modelers have neglected to incorporate the compromise effect in

formal choice models and to test whether such models outperform the

standard value maximization model. In this article, the authors suggest

four context-dependent choice models that can conceptually capture the

compromise effect. Although the models are motivated by theory from

economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to

the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual

concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications,

the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating

the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to

superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization

model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases

in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating

that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and

attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and

empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity,

and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference

point over ``tournament models'' in which each option serves as a reference

point. They discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this

research as well as the ability of the proposed models to predict other

behavioral context effects},

Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a function of the relational

properties of choice alternatives and that the middle option, defined such that its

attribute values are between the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed

as the least extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced

in this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness aversion

is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within each alternative.

In particular, it is argued that an option with equal attribute ratings will be perceived

as the compromise alternative even when it is not the middle option. Data from

three studies support this prediction, offering converging evidence for the attributebalance

effect in different decision contexts. Theoretical implications of the findings

are discussed in the context of the extant extremeness aversion research.},

@article{SchuckPaim.2004,
 abstract = {Normative models of choice in economics and biology usually expect preferences to be consistent across contexts, or ``rational'' in economic language. Following a large body of literature reporting economically irrational behaviour in humans, breaches of rationality by animals have also been recently described. If proven systematic, these findings would challenge long-standing biological approaches to behavioural theorising, and suggest that cognitive processes similar to those claimed to cause irrationality in humans can also hinder optimality approaches to modelling animal preferences. Critical differences between human and animal experiments have not, however, been sufficiently acknowledged. While humans can be instructed conceptually about the choice problem, animals need to be trained by repeated exposure to all contingencies. This exposure often leads to differences in state between treatments, hence changing choices while preserving rationality. We report experiments with European starlings demonstrating that apparent breaches of rationality can result from state-dependence. We show that adding an inferior alternative to a choice set (a ``decoy'') affects choices, an effect previously interpreted as indicating irrationality. However, these effects appear and disappear depending on whether state differences between choice contexts are present or not. These results open the possibility that some expressions of maladaptive behaviour are due to oversights in the migration of ideas between economics and biology, and suggest that key differences between human and nonhuman research must be recognised if ideas are to safely travel between these fields.},

@article{Stroebele.2004,
 abstract = {Eating takes place in a context of environmental stimuli known as ambience. Various external factors such as social and physical surroundings, including the presence of other people and sound, temperature, smell, color, time, and distraction affect food intake and food choice. Food variables such as the temperature, smell, and color of the food also influence food intake and choice differently. However, the influence of ambience on nutritional health is not fully understood. This review summarizes the research on ambient influences on food intake and food choice. The literature suggests that there are major influences of ambience on eating behavior and that the magnitude of the effect of ambience may be underestimated. Changes in intake can be detected with different levels of the number of people present, food accessibility, eating locations, food color, ambient temperatures and lighting, and temperature of foods, smell of food, time of consumption, and ambient sounds. It is suggested that the manipulation of these ambient factors as a whole or individually may be used therapeutically to alter food intake and that more attention needs to be paid to ambience in nutrition-related research.},

 abstract = {There is growing concern about excessive Internet use and whether this can amount to an addiction. In researching this topic, a valid and reliable assessment instrument is essential. In her survey of Internet addiction, Young designed the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), which provides a basis for developments. The IAT has high face validity, but it has not been subjected to systematic psychometric testing. This study sought to replicate and expand Young's survey, and to examine the IAT more systematically. A questionnaire that existed as a Web page was devised, consisting of the IAT and 15 other questions regarding the respondents' demographic information and Internet usage. Participants were recruited through the Internet, yielding 86 valid responses (29 males and 57 females). Factor analysis of the IAT revealed six factors--salience, excessive use, neglecting work, anticipation, lack of control, and neglecting social life. These factors showed good internal consistency and concurrent validity, with salience being the most reliable. Younger and more recent users reported more problems, mainly concerning the neglect of work and social life. We expected interactive Internet functions to be more addictive; however, this was not found to be so. Overall, the IAT is a valid and reliable instrument that may be used in further research on Internet addiction.},

In observational studies participants in different treatment conditions may also differ on pretreatment characteristics that influence outcomes. Propensity score methods can theoretically eliminate these confounds for all observed covariates, but accurate estimation of propensity scores is impeded by large numbers of covariates, uncertain functional forms for their associations with treatment selection, and other problems. This article demonstrates that boosting, a modern statistical technique, can overcome many of these obstacles. The authors illustrate this approach with a study of adolescent probationers in substance abuse treatment programs. Propensity score weights estimated using boosting eliminate most pretreatment group differences and substantially alter the apparent relative effects of adolescent substance abuse treatment.},

contrasts the dualist approach with a single-system framework that conjectures that different types of

reasoning arise through the graded properties of the representations that are utilized while reasoning,

in favor of the alternative framework, which attempts to unify the different forms of reasoning identified

 abstract = {A coupon is a commonly used sales promotion device offering the user a discount on the purchase of a product. Consumer coupon offerings are also becoming increasingly diverse: from ``{\%} off'' and ``{\$} off'' to ``Buy one, Get one free'' (BOGO) offers and co-promotions (Buy X, Deal on Y). This paper reports the results of three experiments that examine whether the economic value of a coupon is a source of information to infer the price of the product/service, and the quality of the product/service, which inference can undercut the economic value, with resulting consequences for deal evaluations and purchase intentions. The framework predicts, and empirical results show, that increasing the value of the coupon does not always improve deal evaluations or purchase intentions. This could imply lower profits for the company. The presence of past price information about the brand, information about prices of other brands offered by the company, and information about competitors' prices moderate the impact of coupon value on brand-related inferences. When such alternate sources of information are present and are diagnostic of the price of the promoted product, consumers are less likely to infer price and quality from the value of the coupon and higher coupon values are more likely to increase deal evaluations and purchase intentions. Implications for managers designing and communicating promotions are offered.},

We review variables known to influence aesthetic judgments, such as figural goodness, figure-ground contrast, stimulus repetition, symmetry, and prototypicality, and trace their effects to changes in processing fluency. Other variables that influence processing fluency, like visual or semantic priming, similarly increase judgments of aesthetic pleasure. Our proposal provides an integrative framework for the study of aesthetic pleasure and sheds light on the interplay between early preferences versus cultural influences on taste, preferences for both prototypical and abstracted forms, and the relation between beauty and truth. In contrast to theories that trace aesthetic pleasure to objective stimulus features per se, we propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a function of stimulus properties.},

@article{Ressler.2004,
 abstract = {A parsimonious account of consciousness is given in which it emerges as a direct consequence of basic neural processes without the necessity of any higher order system. In this model, pleasant or unpleasant conscious feelings of various stimuli in the environment stem from their higher order associations to innate rewards or punishments. When a conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated with a reward, it acquires pleasant feelings due to the temporal correlation of the activations representing its sensory features with those representing innate visceral reward acquisition processes. When the CS is associated with the punishment, it acquires unpleasant feelings due to the correlation of its sensory features with the innate visceral inhibition of punishment acquisition processes. The correlations involve coherent activity between the sensory cortex, the limbic system, the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, and more lateral prefrontal areas where stimuli can be incorporated into working memory. A conscious act involves responses (or attempts to improve the environment) made on the basis of the feelings of such stimuli. Covert memory scans, in which comparisons are made of the reward and punishment associations of the outcomes of previous responses, are related to the motivations and attention behind the conscious selection of a current response. This model appears to fit together various empirical observations. Its relations to some higher or more abstract mental processes, and some evolutionary implications are discussed.},

@article{Rust.2004b,
 abstract = {Most executives today agree that their efforts should be focused on growing the lifetime value of their customers. Yet few companies have come to terms with the implications of that idea for their marketing management. Oldsmobile, for example, enjoyed outstanding brand equity with many customers through the 1980s. But as the century wore further on, the people who loved the Olds got downright old. So why did General Motors spend so many years and so much money trying to reposition and refurbish the tired,tarnished brand? Why didn't GM managers instead move younger buyers along a path of less resistance, toward another of the brands in GM's stable--or even launch a wholly new brand geared to their tastes? Catering to new customers, even at the expense of the brand, would surely have been the path to profits. The reason, argue the authors, is that in large consumer-goods companies like General Motors, brands are the raison d'etre. They are the focus of decision making and the basis of accountability. But this overwhelming focus on growing brand equity is inconsistent with the goal of growing customer equity. Drawing on a wide range of current examples, the authors offer seven tactics that will put brands in the service of growing customer equity. These include replacing traditional brand managers with a new position--the customer segment manager; targeting brands to as narrow an audience as possible; developing the capability and the mind-set to hand off customers from one brand to another within the company; and changing the way brand equity is measured by basing calculations on individual, rather than average, customer data.},

The authors (Chrzan and Orme) compare these strategies in terms of design efficiency and their ability to capture particular effects (main, cross- and alternative-specific effects, and interactions).



CBC software is found to create optimal or near-optimal designs in all cases, with the exception of designs in which many more first-order interactions are modeled relative to main effects. SAS OPTEX software is shown to provide optimal or near-optimal designs in all cases for which it is applicable. For main-effect only designs, minimal level overlap strategies are favored. For higher-order effects, level overlap within tasks is desirable. A special case is demonstrated in which carefully chosen prohibitions between attribute levels can actually improve the efficiency of designs. D-efficiency computation using CBC and SPSS software is detailed in the appendix.

 abstract = {Several studies have shown that consumer choice is often influenced by the context or the set of

alternatives under consideration. Context effects have largely been explained in terms of constructive

preferences that are consistent with 2 theoretical accounts---effort minimization and

perceptual contrast---that emphasize different underlying motivations. We propose that the effect of time pressure on context effects can be used as a moderating variable to determine which of the 2 motives is supported. Specifically, if context effects bias preferences due to effort minimization, time pressure should increase the magnitude of such effects. In contrast, if context effects arise due to an excessive focus on the relational characteristics of the alternatives provided, time pressure should reduce the magnitude of such effects. We examine this proposition in relation to the compromise effect and a choice between an extreme and an all-average option. We find that the compromise effect and the preference for an all-average alternative are both reduced under time pressure. A study using Mouselab provides additional support for the underlying decision mechanisms. We discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for marketers.},

The emphasis is on: - exposing the reader to the major steps associated with the formulation and testing of a model under the LISREL framework - describing the key decisions associated with each step - highlighting potential problems and limitations associated with LISREL modeling - assisting the interpretation of LISREL input and output files. The overall aim is to provide a critical understanding of what is really involved in LISREL modeling and sensitize the reader against mechanically' fitting or modifying models. The entire range of decisions associated with the practical application of the LISREL program is covered in a user-friendly fashion. Concrete examples are used throughout to illustrate issues relating to model conceptualization, specification, identification, estimation, evaluation, modification, and cross-validation and illustrated with actual program output. The program is made much more accessible by adopting the more user-friendly SIMPLIS command language for preparing input files.

preferences. Building on research on the compromise effect, we propose that absolute attribute values often play a

relatively minor role in the construction of preferences and consumers rely primarily on the relative positions of

product alternatives in particular choice sets. Consistent with this proposition, we present the results of three

studies which show that consumers can predict with surprising accuracy the likelihood of selecting a compromise

option based on the product category and relative positions of options on attributes, without knowing the absolute

attribute values (i.e., the location of the set in the attribute space). We also show that providing information about

the range of absolute values does not affect consumers' propensity to rely on the relative positions of options in

choice sets. These results support the notion that, when constructing their preferences, consumers often retrieve

global preference elements (e.g., the relative importance of attributes), and apply them locally with relatively little

sensitivity to the location of the set - i.e. they behave as though their indifference curves ``travel'' with the choice

set.},

@article{Carmon.2000,
 abstract = {We propose that buying-- and selling--price estimates reflect a focus on what the consumer forgoes in the potential exchange and that this notion offers insight into the well--known difference between those two types of value assessment. Buyers and sellers differ not simply in their valuation of the same item but also in how they assess the value. Buyers tend to focus on their sentiment toward what they forgo (typically, the expenditure), and buying prices are thus heavily influenced by variables such as salient reference prices. By the same token, sellers tend to focus on their sentiment toward surrendering the item, and selling prices are hence more heavily influenced by variables such as benefits of possessing the item. Four studies examining buying-- and selling--price estimates of tickets for National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball games offer consistent support for these ideas. The studies show that naturally occurring differences among respondents in attitudes relating to the tickets that sellers forgo (e.g., significance of the game) corresponded more closely to variation in selling prices than in buying prices. Conversely, measures relating to the expenditure (e.g., respondents' concern with money) corresponded more closely to buying prices than to selling prices. Using controlled manipulations we then showed that changes in aspects relating to the game (e.g., expected climate in the stadium) affected selling prices more than buying prices, but changes relating to the expenditure (e.g., list price of the ticket) influenced buying prices more than selling prices. We also showed that drawing attention to the benefits of possessing a ticket before asking for the price estimates influenced buying prices more than selling prices, supporting our claim that otherwise these benefits are naturally more salient to sellers than buyers. Similarly, drawing attention to alternative uses of money before asking for price estimates influenced selling prices more than buying prices.},

Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts in a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the degree of personal commitment to the out--of--stock alternative. The results show that personal commitment to an out--of--stock choice option is a function of preference for the option, whether the option is included in the consumer's consideration set, and the degree to which the stockout announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment to the out--of--stock option increases, consumers react substantially and negatively to the stockout---they report lower satisfaction with the decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal commitment to the out--of--stock option is low and the stockout leads to a decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer response to the stockout can actually be positive.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Critically ill patients vary in their memories of their experience in the intensive care unit. Some have little recall and need to learn about their critical illness. Others have more vivid memories of their experiences, some of which were extremely unpleasant. Patients' not knowing what was happening may have exacerbated the unpleasant experiences.

OBJECTIVES

To elicit the experience of knowing for critically ill patients and to explore the differences in perceptions between patients who were intubated and those who were not intubated during the illness.

METHODS

Grounded theory was used to explore the meaning of knowing and not knowing and the process by which knowing occurs. Unstructured interviews were done with 14 patients.

RESULTS

Knowing had 2 phases: the need to know (1) during and (2) after the critical illness. The first phase had 3 facets: needing information, needing to be oriented, and having confusing perceptions. The second phase had 2 facets: needing information about what had happened and piecing together events. Many experiences with knowing during and after a critical illness were similar for both intubated and nonintubated patients. The main difference was the intensity of the experience in some categories.

CONCLUSIONS

Critically ill patients have a strong need to know throughout and after their time in the intensive care unit. Nurses must address this need for constant reorientation to the past and present in these patients. In addition, adequate nursing staff must be available for these patients.},

@article{Hutchinson.2000,
 abstract = {Behavioral researchers use analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of differences

between treatment means or chi-square tests of differences between proportions

to provide support for empirical hypotheses about consumer behavior. These tests

are typically conducted on data from ``between-subjects'' experiments in which

participants were randomly assigned to conditions. We show that, despite using

internally valid experimental designs such as this, aggregation biases can arise in

which the theoretically critical pattern holds in the aggregate even though it holds

for no (or few) individuals. First, we show that crossover interactions---often taken

as strong evidence of moderating variables---can arise from the aggregation of

two or more segments that do not exhibit such interactions when considered separately.

Second, we show that certain context effects that have been reported for

choice problems can result from the aggregation of two (or more) segments that

do not exhibit these effects when considered separately. Given these threats to

the conclusions drawn from experimental results, we describe the conditions under

which unobserved heterogeneity can be ruled out as an alternative explanation

based on one or more of the following: a priori considerations, derived properties,

diagnostic statistics, and the results of latent class modeling. When these tests

cannot rule out explanations based on unobserved heterogeneity, this is a serious

problem for theorists who assume implicitly that the same theoretical principle

works equally for everyone, but for random error. The empirical data patterns

revealed by our diagnostics can expose the weakness in the theory but not fix it.

It remains for the researcher to do further work to understand the underlying constructs

that drive heterogeneity effects and to revise theory accordingly.},

Heute kann sich bei einer versch{\"a}rften internationalen Konkurrenz und steigenden Kundenanforderungen in s{\"a}mtlichen Wirtschaftsbereichen kaum mehr ein Unternehmen dieser Thematik entziehen. Deshalb hat sich die Erkenntnis durchgesetzt, da{\ss} die Sicherung und st{\"a}ndige Verbesserung von Dienstleistungsqualit{\"a}t zu den Grundvoraussetzungen f{\"u}r {\"U}berlebensf{\"a}higkeit und Erfolg auf M{\"a}rkten geh{\"o}ren. Bemerkenswert ist, da{\ss} in den letzten Jahren auch Dienstleister aus dem Non-Profit-Sektor die Dienstleistungsproblematik aufgegriffen und entsprechende Managementprogramme eingef{\"u}hrt haben. Der Spannungsbogen reicht von Kulturorganisationen bis hin zu Institutionen des Gesundheitswesens. Die dritte Auflage tr{\"a}gt der zunehmenden praktischen Erfahrung mit Fragen der Messung und des Managements von Dienstleistungsqualit{\"a}t sowie der Ausweitung des Anwendungsfeldes ebenso Rechnung wie der Tatsache, da{\ss} diese Aspekte ein zunehmendes wissenschaftliches Interesse gefunden haben},

The first was to replicate the study of Sawyer and Howard (1991), which found that the effects of persuasion in open-ended advertisements were greater than those of closed-ended advertisements when the audience was involved in processing the ads. The second was to examine a potential boundary condition of these findings based on complexity of the product featured in the advertisement and the audience's ability to process the information. An experiment using 211 student subjects replicated the results of Sawyer and Howard when the same low-complexity product was featured in the target advertisement. However, the results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression (LOGIT) analyses on four measures of persuasion (attitude toward the brand, effort, purchase intention, and choice) showed that the effects Sawyer and Howard found for their relatively simple product (razor) did not hold for a complex product (CD player) except for purchase intention. Further examination of the role of the subject's ability to process the complex product advertisement showed little difference from the over-all group in the complex product condition.},

The alternative can be asymmetrically dominated, asymmetrically dominating, totally dominated, or totally dominating. We developed a theoretically derived model based on the shifts in attribute valuation as a potential explanation for all context effects. First, the model is tested using data from previously published studies. As predicted, the results showed a high correlation between shifts in valuation and changes in the choice shares. The model is also tested using 2 studies that extend the design of the choice sets to include better alternatives in a search context and the removal of an alternative. The strong relation justifies the case for comparative valuation as an underlying mechanism for context effects. Assuming this valuation, the article illustrates how the framework can be used to develop new product strategies taking into account the values of the unchosen alternatives.},

@article{Briley.2000,
 abstract = {We argue that a way culture influences decisions is through the reasons that

individuals recruit when required to explain their choices. Specifically, we propose

that cultures endow individuals with different rules or principles that provide guidance

for making decisions, and a need to provide reasons activates such cultural

knowledge. This proposition, representing a dynamic rather than dispositional view

of cultural influence, is investigated in studies of consumer decisions that involve

a trade-off between diverging attributes, such as low price and high quality. Principles

enjoining compromise are more salient in East Asian cultures than in North

American culture, and accordingly, we predict that cultural differences in the tendency

to choose compromise options will be greater when the decision task requires

that participants provide reasons. In study 1, a difference between Hong

Kong Chinese and North American participants in the tendency to select compromise

products emerged only when they were asked to explain their decisions, with

Hong Kong decision makers more likely and Americans less likely to compromise.

Content analysis of participants' reasons confirmed that cultural differences in the

frequency of generating particular types of reasons mediated the difference in

choices. Studies 2 and 3 replicate the interactive effect of culture and the need to

provide reasons in a comparison of North American versus Japanese participants

and in a comparison of European-American and Asian-American participants, respectively.

Studies 4 and 5 found that Hong Kong Chinese participants, compared

with Americans, evaluate proverbs and the reasons of others more positively when

these favor compromise. We discuss the value of conceptualizing cultural influences

in terms of dynamic strategies rather than as dispositional tendencies},

To that end, this article addresses two fundamental research issues. Using a qualitative study, the authors first develop a generalizable typology of quality dimensions for durable goods that includes ease of use, versatility, durability, serviceability, performance, and prestige. Second, the authors conduct a process-tracing laboratory experiment to examine how key marketing variables---price, brand name, and product attributes---affect consumers' judgment processes and inferences about how products perform on the six quality dimensions. Results of the experiment indicate that consumers use price and brand name differently to judge the quality dimensions, searching for price and brand name much more frequently when evaluating prestige than when evaluating any other quality dimension. Results suggest that managers must determine the relevant quality dimensions for a product category and the cues that are salient for judging those dimensions.},

 abstract = {Meta-analysis is now a widely used technique for summarizing evidence from multiple studies. Publication bias, the bias induced by the fact that research with statistically significant results is potentially more likely to be submitted and published than work with null or non-significant results, poses a thereat to the validity of such analyses. The implication of this is that combining only the identified published studies uncritically may lead to an incorrect, usually over optimistic, conclusion. How publication bias should be addressed when carrying out a meta-analysis is currently a hotly debated subject. While statistical methods to test for its presence are starting be used, they do not address the problem of how to proceed if publication bias is suspected. This paper provides a review of methods, which can be employed as a sensitivity analysis to assess the likely impact of publication bias on a meta-analysis. It is hoped that this will raise awareness of such methods, and promote their use and development, as well as provide an agenda for future research.},

 abstract = {This research investigates the interaction between a very common task, explaining

decisions, and an individual difference, need for uniqueness (NFU), on buyer decision

making. We propose that explaining (or providing reasons for) decisions

shifts the focus from the choice of options to the choice of reasons. Furthermore,

buyers who explain their decisions and have high NFU tend to select unconventional

reasons and are, consequently, more likely to make unconventional choices.

These predictions were supported in a series of studies involving choices between

conventional and less-conventional options, such as whether to switch to a brand

on sale, whether to select a compromise option, and whether to accept a gamble

with a possible loss. The findings also indicate that the effects of providing reasons

are not due to attempts to act rationally or to concerns about being evaluated.

Three boundary conditions on the generalization that high NFU consumers who

provide reasons tend to make unconventional choices were examined, all involving

forces that promote conformity over uniqueness. They include evaluation by others,

explicit information about the preferences of others, and negative feedback on

previous decision performance. We discuss the implications of this research with

respect to the roles of explanations, NFU, and accountability in buyer decision

making.},

 abstract = {We review 74 experiments with no, low, or high performance-based financial incentives. The modal

result is no effect on mean performance though variance is usually reduced by higher payment.. Higher

incentive does improve performance often, typically judgment tasks that are responsive to better effort.

Incentives also reduce ``presentation'' effects 

e.g., generosity and risk-seeking.. Incentive effects are

comparable to effects of other variables, particularly ``cognitive capital'' and task ``production'' demands,

and interact with those variables, so a narrow-minded focus on incentives alone is misguided.

We also note that no replicated study has made rationality violations disappear purely by raising

incentives.},

The authors investigate the relationship between two focal constructs in the debate: market orientation and product innovation. On the basis of a sample of U.S. manufacturing companies, the authors' analysis shows that product innovation varies with market orientation. Specifically, (1) customer orientation increases the introduction of new-to-the-world products and reduces the launching of me-too products, (2) competitor orientation increases the introduction of me-too products and reduces the launching of line extensions and new-to-the-world products, and (3) interfunctional coordination increases the launching of line extensions and reduces the introduction of me-too products.},

A major concern expressed by critics is that such testing is misunderstood by many of those who use it. Several other objections to its use have also been raised. In this article the author reviews and comments on the claimed misunderstandings as well as on other criticisms of the approach, and he notes arguments that have been advanced in support of NHST. Alternatives and supplements to NHST are considered, as are several related recommendations regarding the interpretation of experimental data. The concluding opinion is that NHST is easily misunderstood and misused but that when applied with good judgment it can be an effective aid to the interpretation of experimental data.

@article{Nowlis.2000,
 abstract = {Although brand switching is one of the most researched topics in marketing, we still know very little about the moderators of switching between brands in different price-quality tiers (e.g., from H{\"a}agen--Dazs ice cream to Breyers or to a store brand). Building on the notion that buyers have a (category-specific) consideration set of price--quality tiers, we propose that sales promotions and the choice set composition (or the choice context) have compensatory effects on brand switching between price--quality tiers. Specifically, if one of these factors causes buyers to switch to a higher price--quality tier within their brand-tier consideration set, then the other factor is less likely to induce switching in the same direction (to an even higher tier) and more likely to induce switching in the opposite direction. This general proposition leads to several specific hypotheses, including (a) the likelihood of switching between particular brand tiers due to price promotions can be predicted based on the choice set composition; (b) asymmetric switching, whereby consumers are more likely to switch up from a low-tier to a promoted high-tier brand than from a high-tier to a promoted low-tier brand, is reduced or eliminated if consumers consider three price--quality tiers; and (c) the compromise effect is reduced when the lowest tier brand offers a price promotion. These hypotheses were supported in a series of studies, which also examined rival explanations. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

Participants made judgments of attractiveness, justifiability, and

the degree to which decoy effects reflected shifts in dimensional

other alternatives in the set. Both emergent-value and value-shift

models of inferior decoy effects were supported, but only the

emergent-value model of compromise decoy effects was supported.

Results for the phantom decoy indicated that this effect

 abstract = {Notes that consumers who compare products often evaluate products more favorably when the products have unique positive features but common negative features than when they have unique negative features but common positive ones. Two studies (Exp 1 and Exp 2, n=64) examined contingencies in the occurrence of these {\textquotedbl}cancellation{\textquotedbl} effects and explored their implications for people's evaluations of the products being compared and other products they encounter subsequently. Some subjects (Ss) were explicitly told to compare 2 products at the time they received information about them. They not only disregarded the products' common features when initially evaluating these products, but disregarded evaluatively similar features of a 3rd product they encountered some time later. Other Ss were initially told to describe each product separately. In this condition, they formed an overall impression of each product individually, and so cancellation effects were not apparent. Nevertheless, their preference for one product over the other was based on a comparison of the products' individual features that they could recall at the time of judgment rather than on the global impressions they had formed when the product information was first presented.},

 abstract = {Economists, psychologists, and marketing researchers rely on measures of consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) in estimating demand for private and public goods and in designing optimal price schedules. Existing market research techniques for measuring WTP differ in whether they provide an incentive to consumers to reveal their true WTP and in whether they simulate actual point-of-purchase contexts. The authors present an empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP. In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding. They also control for strategic response behavior.},

@article{Boatwright.2001,
 abstract = {Most supermarket categories are cluttered with items, or stockkeeping units (SKUs), that differ very little at the attribute level. Previous research has found that reductions (up to 54{\%}) in the number of low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94{\%} of the categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered, particularly low-selling SKUs. Sales were indeed affected dramatically, increasing an average of 11{\%} across the 42 categories examined. Sales rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which experienced an increase of 10{\%} or more; 75{\%} of households increased their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors examine how different types of SKU reductions---defined by how the cuts affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the number of brands)---affected purchase behavior differently. The results indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand--size combination that was eliminated, nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also, contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are brand and flavor.},

 abstract = {There is evidence that caffeine increases alertness and reduces fatigue. This may be especially so in low arousal situations (e.g. working at night or for prolonged hours). Caffeine has also been found to improve performance on vigilance tasks and simple tasks requiring sustained response. Again, these effects are often clearest when alertness is reduced, although there is evidence that benefits may still occur when the individual is unimpaired. Most studies to date have investigated the behavioural effects of caffeine in laboratory experiments using artificial tasks. In the current study 3 mg/kg caffeine was found to improve steering accuracy in a 1 h simulated drive. Measures of mood and performance on a sustained attention task also showed the benefits of caffeine. These findings suggest that laboratory results reflect a general benefit of caffeine that may also be observed in real-life situations. Other evidence examining the effects of caffeine on performance efficiency over the working day has shown the benefits of caffeine consumption on measures of sustained attention and alertness. This study also provided evidence suggesting that caffeine is often consumed when alertness is low to maximise alertness and performance efficiency. The implications of these findings for road safety are also considered. Copyright 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Our game-theoretic model helps us identify a set of conditions under which the optimal strategy for the retailer is to position the store brand as close as possible to the stronger national brand. In three empirical studies, we examined whether market data are consistent with some of the implications of our model. In the first study, using observational data from two US supermarket chains, we found that store brands are more likely to target stronger national brands. Our second study estimated cross-price effects in 19 product categories, and found that only in categories with high-quality store brands, store brand and the leading national brand compete more intensely with each other than with the secondary national brand. In a third product perception study, we found that although explicit targeting by store brands influenced consumer perceptions of physical similarity, it had no influence on consumers' perceptions of overall or product quality similarity. While it appears that retailers do follow a positioning strategy consistent with our model, it changes buying behavior in the intended fashion only if the store brand offers quality comparable to the leading national brands},

@article{Shafir.2002,
 abstract = {Contrary to the theory of rational choice, adding an alternative to a set of available options often affects people's judgement of the preexisting options. Here, we show that honeybees (Apis mellifera) and gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) are also influenced by the addition of an option to a choice set (i.e., by a change in local context). Like humans, our subjects violated basic properties of rational choice. Their relative preference between two original options changed with the introduction of a third, relatively unattractive option. Such context-dependent choice violates the constant-ratio rule. Our subjects increased their relative preference for the more similar of two alternatives, contrary to the similarity hypothesis. The jays also increased their absolute preference for the more similar of two alternatives, in violation of regularity. Thus, the principle of irrelevant alternatives, which assumes that preference between options does not depend on the presence or absence of other options, is violated not only by humans, but also by an invertebrate and a nonhuman vertebrate. These findings contradict the view that nonhuman animals should be immune to such psychological effects and that they should conform with normative accounts, such as rationality or optimal-foraging theory, because their decision-making processes are evolutionarily adaptive. We discuss the potential generality of context-dependent effects and suggest that such effects should be incorporated into decision-making models in behavioral ecology.},

constrained by the degree of perceived fit between the brand and extension

product categories. However, there are many examples of brands

that have been extended successfully into {\textquotedbl}perceptually distant{\textquotedbl} domains.

Drawing on theories of consumer information processing and product

adoption, the authors identify three background traits of prior work that

may help explain the discrepancy between prior research and marketplace

observation: (1) limited extension information, (2) failure to account

for consumers' new product adoption tendencies (i.e., earlier versus

later), and (3) single exposure to proposed extensions. In this study, the

authors find that the effects of fit disappear when attribute information is

added to extension stimuli and are applicable only for later product

adopters. The authors also find that perceived fit increases with greater

exposure to an extension. Beyond implications for brand extension

research, this study underscores the need to recognize that certain

research design factors related to external validity, which are often

assumed irrelevant, can alter what is held to be true.},

Perceived difficulties with vegetarian diets, the number of vegetarian significant others and beliefs about meat were important predictors of meat consumption. There were differences between men and women and members of different age groups, which should be taken into account when attempts are made to influence meat consumption. For example, health promotion campaigns that focus on whether or not meat is necessary in the diet may influence meat consumption, but would be most successful if directed predominantly at older people and men. In contrast, the meat consumption of women and younger people was strongly associated with more specific concerns about lack of iron and protein in the vegetarian diet. Some of the difficulties people find with vegetarian diets will also apply to plant-based diets generally, and such diets are becoming more widely acknowledged as providing health benefits. Therefore, the findings have important implications for public health.},

The modelling of such data is intrinsically more difficult than the modelling of continuous data due to the constraints on the underlying probabilities and the reduced amount of information that discrete outcomes contain. In this paper we discuss the class of cumulative logit models, which provide a natural framework for ordinal data analysis. We show how viewing the categorical outcome as the discretization of an underlying continuous response allows a natural interpretation of model parameters. We also show how covariates are incorporated into the model and how various types of correlation among repeated measures on the same individual may be accounted for. The models are illustrated using longitudinal allergy data consisting of sneezing scores measured on a four-point scale. Our approach throughout is Bayesian and we present a range of simple diagnostics to aid model building.},

To further our theoretical understanding, we extend the notion of Gestalt to consumers' perceptions of retail environments and demonstrated that consumers perceive Servicescapes holistically. Specifically, we suggest that the arousing quality of ambient stimuli is one dimension along which holistic evaluations occur, and that pleasant ambient stimuli are perceived more positively when their arousing qualities match rather than mismatch.



We manipulated scent and music in a 3 (no music, pleasant low arousal and high arousal music) by 3 (no scent, pleasant low and high arousal scents) factorial design in a field setting. Our findings show that when ambient scent and music are congruent with each other in terms of their arousing qualities, consumers rate the environment significantly more positive, exhibit higher levels of approach and impulse buying behaviors, and experience enhanced satisfaction than when these environmental cues were at odds with each other.},

Four meta--analyses investigating response homogeneity (cumulative N {\textgreater} 650,000) and 30 meta--analyses reporting effect sizes for 65 behavioral or psychological relationships (cumulative N {\textgreater} 350,000) provided comparative data for college student subjects and nonstudent (adult) subjects for the present research. In general, responses of college student subjects were found to be slightly more homogeneous than those of nonstudent subjects. Moreover, effect sizes derived from college student subjects frequently differed from those derived from nonstudent subjects both directionally and in magnitude. Because there was no systematic pattern to the differences observed, caution must be exercised when attempting to extend any relationship found using college student subjects to a nonstudent (adult) population.

 abstract = {Applying attribution theory to consumer behavior issues is quite common. In the managerial arena, previous research suggests that salespeople's attribution processes affect their expectancies for success and future behavior. However, no published research has developed adequate measures that might be used to examine the full range of attributional responses for sales success or failure and the behaviors that are likely to follow such attributions. The goal of this research is to develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral scales for sales success and failure and validate such scales in a real-world context---among field sales representatives. Following Churchill's (1979) recommended process, the authors develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral intention scales that is applicable to a field sales force setting.

 abstract = {The main and accessory olfactory systems have received considerable attention on the part of scientists and clinicians during the last decade, largely because of (a) quantum advances in understanding their genetically expressed receptor mechanisms, (b) evidence that their receptor cells undergo neurogenesis and both programmed and induced cell death, and (c) important technical and practical developments in psychophysical measurement. The latter developments have led to the proliferation of standardized olfactory testing in laboratories and clinics, and to the discovery that smell loss is among the first signs of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Recent controversial claims that humans possess a functioning vomeronasal system responsive to {\textquotedbl}pheromones{\textquotedbl} has added further interest in intranasal chemoreception. This review focuses on recent progress made in understanding olfactory function, emphasizing transduction, measurement, and clinical findings.},

@article{Higgins.2001,
 abstract = {A new task goal elicits a feeling of pride in individuals with a subjective history of success, and this achievment pride produces anticipatory goal reactions that energize and direct behavior to approach the task goal. By distinguishing between promotion pride and prevention pride, the present paper extends this classic model of achievement motivation. Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) distinguishes between a promotion focus on hopes and accomplishments (gains) and a prevention focus on safety and responsibilities (non-losses). We propose that a subjective history of success with promotion-related eagerness (promotion pride) orients individuals toward using eagerness means to approach a new task goal, whereas a subjective history of success with prevention-related vigilance (prevention pride) orients individuals toward using vigilance means to approach a new task goal. Studies 1--3 tested this proposal by examining the relations between a new measure of participants' subjective histories of promotion success and prevention success (the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ)) and their achievement strategies in different tasks. Study 4 examined the relation between participants' RFQ responses and their reported frequency of feeling eager or vigilant in past task engagements. Study 5 used an experimental priming technique to make participants temporarily experience either a subjective history of promotion success or a subjective history of prevention success. For both chronic and situationally induced achievement pride, these studies found that when approaching task goals individuals with promotion pride use eagerness means whereas individuals with prevention pride use vigilance means},

Publication selection exists when editors, reviewers, or researchers have a preference for statistically significant results. Because all areas of empirical research are susceptible to publication selection, any average or tally of significant/insignificant studies is likely to be biased and potentially misleading. Meta-regression analysis can see through the murk of random sampling error and selected misspecification bias to identify the underlying statistical structures that characterize genuine empirical effect. Meta-significance testing and precision-effect testing (PET) are offered as a means to identify empirical effect beyond publication bias and are applied to four areas of empirical economics research -- minimum wage effects, union-productivity effects, price  elasticities, and tests of the natural rate hypothesis.},

respondents' preferences for choice alternatives, their diligence in

providing responses, and the accessibility of attitudes and the speed of

thinking. Thus, the model distinguishes between respondents who are

quick to think and those who are quick to react but do so without much

thought. Empirically, the authors find support for the endogenous nature

of response times and demonstrate that models that treat response

@article{Rubaltelli.2008,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Despite being still at the experimental level, xenotransplantation may become an effective strategy to overcome the scarcity of human organs. However, at the present time there is considerable resistance to this kind of biomedical technology. The aim of the present study was to identify novel strategies to reduce patients' negative affective reactions towards xenotransplantation helping them to understand the advantages of xenotransplantation in a more analytical fashion and increase their acceptance for this approach.

METHODS

The study was conducted in a group of patients with liver cirrhosis waiting for liver transplantation. They were presented with hypothetical scenarios and asked to choose among either two or three alternative types of donor defined by their species (e.g., livers from humans vs. other species) and availability (low for human donors and high for livers from non-human species).

RESULTS

Patients were unwilling to accept xenotransplantation if they were presented with livers from humans (chosen by 97.5{\%} of participants) vs. livers from genetically modified pigs (2.5{\%}). On the other hand, a different group of patients was significantly more willing to accept xenotransplantation if they were presented with three different types of donors: respectively, human beings (74.4{\%}), genetically modified pigs (25.6{\%}) and genetically modified dogs. In addition, human livers were judged significantly more attractive than genetically modified livers from pigs, monkeys, dogs, or sheep and pig livers were rated as significantly more attractive than livers from monkeys, dogs, or sheep (for all comparisons P {\textless} 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS

These results demonstrate that paradigms from other fields, like decision-making, might help to communicate more effectively the potential of xenotransplantation, modulating patients' affective reactions and allowing them to understand the potential strengths of this biomedical technology.},

@article{Oppenheimer.2008,
 abstract = {Fluency--the ease with which people process information--is a central piece of information we take into account when we make judgments about the world. Prior research has shown that fluency affects judgments in a wide variety of domains, including frequency, familiarity, and confidence. In this paper, we present evidence that fluency also plays a role in categorization judgments. In Experiment 1, participants judged a variety of different exemplars to be worse category members if they were less fluent (because they were presented in a smaller typeface). In Experiment 2, we found that fluency also affected judgments of feature typicality. In Experiment 3, we demonstrated that the effects of fluency can be reversed when a salient attribution for reduced fluency is available (i.e., the stimuli are hard to read because they were printed by a printer with low toner). In Experiment 4 we replicated these effects using a within-subject design, which ruled out the possibility that the effects were a statistical artifact caused by aggregation of data. We propose a possible mechanism for these effects: if an exemplar and its category are closely related, activation of one will cause priming of the other, leading to increased fluency. Over time, feelings of fluency come to be used as a valid cue that can become confused with more traditional sources of information about category membership.},

We propose that such heuristics are used more for time because, compared to monetary expenditures, temporal expenditures are harder to account for. Consistent with this proposition, when participants in both time and money conditions are primed to account for their expenditures, they no longer differ in their use of heuristics. The associated response times offer additional process evidence (experiment 3).},

@article{Sharpe.2008,
 abstract = {This article illustrates how the compromise effect alters consumers' selection of

soft drinks. Using three within-subject studies, we show that extremeness aversion

and price insensitivity cause consumers to increase their consumption when the

smallest drink size is dropped or when a larger drink size is added to a set. As a

result rational firms find it best to drop the smaller sizes and add a larger size,

thus increasing overall consumption. After estimating each individual's demand as

a function of price and drink size availability, policy experiments demonstrate how

it is possible to reduce soft drink consumption without additional taxation.},

@article{Silvera.2008,
 abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this research is to examine predictors of impulse buying. Although moderate levels of impulse buying can be pleasant and gratifying, recent theoretical work suggests that chronic, high frequency impulse buying has a compulsive element and can function as a form of escape from negative affective states, depression, and low self-esteem.



Design/methodology/approach -- The present research empirically tests a theoretical model of impulse buying by examining the associations between chronic impulse buying tendencies and subjective wellbeing, affect, susceptibility to interpersonal influence, and self-esteem.



Findings -- Results indicate that the cognitive facet of impulse buying, associated with a lack of planning in relation to purchase decisions, is negatively associated with subjective wellbeing. The affective facet of impulse buying, associated with feelings of excitement and an overpowering urge to buy, is linked to negative affect and susceptibility to interpersonal influence.



Practical implications -- Given the link to negative emotions and potentially harmful consequences, impulse buying may be viewed as problematic consumer behavior. Reductions in problematic impulse buying could be addressed through public policy or social marketing.



Originality/value -- This study validates and extends the Verplanken et al. model by examining the relationship between impulse buying and other psychological constructs (i.e. subjective wellbeing, positive and negative affect, social influence, and self-esteem).},

The empirical results for the years from 2001 to 2003 indicate that private and non-profit hospitals are on average less cost efficient and less technically efficient than publicly owned hospitals. The hospital rankings based on estimated efficiency scores turn out to be negatively correlated with average length of stay, which is highest in private hospitals.

This may cause neighborhoods to decay and the quality of life of its inhabitants to deteriorate. For a city government, this may be a vital policy issue. But does disorder really spread in neighborhoods? So far there has not been strong empirical support, and it is not clear what constitutes disorder and what may make it spread. We generated hypotheses about the spread of disorder and tested them in six field experiments. We found that, when people observe that others violated a certain social norm or legitimate rule, they are more likely to violate other norms or rules, which causes disorder to spread.},

This review gives a systematic overview on physicians' perspectives on influences, strategies, and consequences of health-care rationing. Relevant references as identified by systematically screening major electronic databases and manuscript references were synthesized by thematic analysis. Retrieved studies focused on themes that fell under three major headings: (i) conditions and influences of BSR, (ii) strategies of BSR, and (iii) consequences of BSR. The range of themes indicates that physicians' rationing behavior is highly variable, strongly influenced by context-related factors, and consists mainly of implicit rationing strategies. Torn between patient advocacy and the obligation to contain costs, physicians experience various role conflicts. The development of explicit rationing strategies seems necessary to avoid arbitrary BSR and allow a fair allocation of health-care resources.},

@article{Cruppe.2007,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimum hospital procedure volumes are discussed as an instrument for quality assurance. In 2004 Germany introduced such annual minimum volumes nationwide on five surgical procedures: kidney, liver, stem cell transplantation, complex oesophageal, and pancreatic interventions. The present investigation is the first part of a study evaluating the effects of these minimum volumes on health care provision. Research questions address how many hospitals and cases were affected by minimum volume regulations in 2004, how affected hospitals were distributed according to minimum volumes, and how many hospitals within the 16 German states complied with the standards set for 2004. METHODS: The evaluation is based on the mandatory hospital quality reports for 2004. In the reports, all hospitals are statutorily obliged to state the number of procedures performed for each minimum volume. The data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: In 2004, 485 out of 1710 German hospitals providing acute care and approximately 0.14{\%} of all hospital cases were affected by minimum volume regulations. Liver, kidney, and stem cell transplantation affected from 23 to hospitals; complex oesophageal and pancreatic interventions affected from 297 to 455 hospitals. The inter-state comparison of the average hospital care area demonstrates large differences between city states and large area states and the eastern and western German states ranging from a minimum 51 km2 up to a maximum 23.200 km2, varying according to each procedure. A range of 9{\%} - 16{\%} of the transplantation hospitals did not comply with the standards affecting 1{\%} - 2{\%} of the patients whereas 29{\%} and 18{\%} of the hospitals treating complex oesophageal and pancreatic interventions failed the standards affecting 2{\%} - 5{\%} of the prevailing cases. CONCLUSION: In 2004, the newly introduced minimum volume regulations affected only up to a quarter of German acute care hospitals and few cases. However, excluding the hospitals not meeting the minimum volume standards from providing the respective procedures deserves considering two aspects: the hospital health care provision concepts by the German states as being responsible and from a patient perspective the geographically equal access to hospital care.},

Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of {\textquotedbl}blink{\textquotedbl}: the election of Warren Harding; {\textquotedbl}New Coke{\textquotedbl}; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of {\textquotedbl}thin-slicing{\textquotedbl}--Filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.},

increase the choice share of one of the core options, even when the added alternatives

are dominated by both options in the core set. We further show that the

observed effect is a function of consumers' mode of information processing and

is more pronounced in the context of intuitive (System 1) processing than analytic

Studies 2--5 were mainly to examine the effects of emotional conditions on consumer decision. The results of studies 2--5 substantiated our prediction that participants in positive emotional states were less likely to respond to puffer advertising and sales promotion, thus increasing the share of an option that is ``average'' in all dimensions, and more likely to have a compromise effect than in those in a negative emotional condition. Studies 2--5 also found that the emotional effects were moderated by individuals' openness to their own feelings.

Results of Studies 3 and 4 show that Koreans and Korean students of Oriental medicine scored higher on the AHS than did Americans and Korean students of non-Oriental medicine majors, respectively. Studies 5 and 6 tested predictive validity by examining associations of the AHS with performances on two cognitive tasks (categorization and causal reasoning).

a manner similar to duration of actual ownership. We examine this effect in two experiments, both variations of the

classic mug experiment. To induce different levels of exposure, we varied the amount of time that participants examined

the auctioned item (i.e., coffee mugs) prior to participating in real dollar auctions. In the first study, participants bid in

online English open bid auctions. In the second study, participants bid in first-price sealed bid auctions. In both cases of

duration of physical contact positively influenced valuations (i.e., bid levels).},

In Experiment 2, social exclusion was directly induced through an on-line virtual interaction, and participants who were excluded reported greater desire for warm food and drink than did participants who were included. These findings are consistent with the embodied view of cognition and support the notion that social perception involves physical and perceptual content.

As a measure of earnings risk, we use the cross-sectional variation in earnings that is left unexplained by human capital variables in Mincerian wage regressions. Our evidence shows that individuals with low willingness to take risks are more likely to work in occupations with low earnings risk.

@article{Boutrolle.2007,
 abstract = {Marketing professionals and sensory scientists have several hedonic testing methods at their disposal to assess product acceptability. The central location test (CLT) which usually takes place in a standardised location under controlled conditions is more frequently used than the home use test (HUT). Given the artificial conditions of a CLT, it is assumed that a more realistic HUT yields more relevant hedonic data in spite of the uncontrolled conditions. This study compares CLT and HUT results using different types of products. Three experiments were conducted respectively with a fermented milk beverage, salted crackers and sparkling water. For each hedonic test, two samples were presented by a monadic sequential mode.



The comparison of CLT and HUT data sets shows that for each category, the products get higher scores when tested at home (HUT) than when tested under CLT conditions. Also, we found that the influence of the method used depends on the type of product to be tested. The conclusion of the hedonic test (i.e. significant difference between the two products) is affected by the method for some products (crackers) whereas the conclusion remains unchanged for other products (fermented milk beverage and sparkling water). In order to explain the varying influence of the tasting conditions, some hypotheses based on the way the products are usually eaten are discussed.},

@article{Gunasti.2008,
 abstract = {You go to an auto parts store to purchase a set of four snow

tires. The dealer shows you two options. Brand X costs {\$}90 per

tire and has a tag on it that indicates that it has a traction

rating of 5.1 out of 7. Brand Y costs {\$}125 per tire and the

traction rating on its tag is 6.3 out of 7. The tags indicate that

the traction ratings are provided by the same well respected

auto magazine. Just as you are about ready to choose Brand

Y because of its better traction rating, the dealer tells you that

the store also carries Brand W that costs only {\$}60 per tire, but

that the magazine has not provided a traction rating for it. You

consider the idea of buying that tire for a minute. You decide

that you are not going to buy it without knowing the traction

rating, but even so the total cost is only {\$}240 for a set of 4 tires

compared to {\$}500 for a set of the Brand Y. Maybe it is not

worth paying so much after all. You ask yourself: what is the

difference between a 5.1 vs. 6.3 rating anyhow? As you think

more about it, paying {\$}360 for a set of Brand X tires seems like

a better choice and you change your initial decision of buying

Brand Y.

In the scenario above, introducing a third option, even though

this option was missing a crucial piece of information, changed the

initial choice in the binary set and increased the choice probability

of the middle option in the new choice set. If the marketer had not

mentioned the third option, the final decision would have been

different. Some reflection suggests that consumers face numerous

similar scenarios during their purchases. For instance, the local

wine store where the authors live, like many other internet and

bricks and mortar wine merchants, regularly reports wine evaluation

scores from the Wine Spectator, a respected and apparently

unbiased wine magazine. These scores are reported for some wines

and not for others for two reasons, first because Wine Spectator

cannot possibly rate every wine, and second because the wine

merchants may choose not to report the scores.

Brands gain share when they become center options in a choice

set (Simonson 1989). This phenomenon, known as the compromise

effect, has been shown in past literature when a third option (W or

Z) was added to a binary choice set (X, Y). In the vast majority of

cases there was a large and significant increase in the choice of the

option (X or Y) adjacent to the newly added option as the existing

option takes the middle or compromise position in the new X, Y, Z

or W, X, Y set. In these studies, all options were described with two

attributes each, and all attribute information was provided. The new

option (W or Z) was relatively better than X and Y on one attribute

and relatively inferior to X and Y on the other attribute.

In this manuscript, we investigate whether the introduction of

a third option with a missing attribute also leads to a compromise

effect. As one of its attributes is unknown, this new option can have

any value for that attribute. Thus, it may actually be much better or

worse than X or Y on either dimensions and away from the tradeoff

line (as defined in Sheng et al. 2005). Due to its missing attribute

and its unknown location in the choice set, this alternative will

generally achieve a low choice probability. Hence we refer to it as

the shadow option. It is important to note that a shadow option is a

distinct concept from that of a phantom decoy used in earlier

literature (Simonson 1989). More specifically, shadow options

have missing attribute information but they may still be chosen by

the decision maker, whereas phantom decoys have complete attribute

information but they are not available for choice.

In three empirical studies, we investigate the robustness of the

compromise effect achieved by the addition of a shadow option to

a binary choice set. In the first study, we show that the compromise

effect holds for a newly added option when only one attribute is

available (one attribute is missing) as well as when both attributes

are available (no attributes are missing). There is an important

distinction between the two cases, because in the case of missing

attribute information the newly added alternative may actually be

better or worse than the existing ones, whereas in the case of

complete information the new option will be superior to both

existing options on one attribute and inferior on the other.

In the second study, we demonstrate that the shadow option

(W or Z) alters choice probabilities in favor of the adjacent option

whether it is next to X or to Y (i.e. WXY or XYZ). In either case, the

choice of the new compromise option is increased. Also in this

study, the missing attribute types are reversed, and different types

of products are included. It is demonstrated that the effect is

independent of attribute or product type. In the third study, we

examine three important issues. First we investigate whether the

effect occurs due to attribute polarization (extreme attribute values

of the shadow option). Second, asking some participants to make

explicit inferences about the missing attributes, we also identify

where they locate the third (shadow) option in their mental maps

relative to the other two options and therefore, we are able to show

that the observed effect is in fact a compromise effect rather than

another violation of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA).

Finally, we explore how being prompted to make explicit inferences

about missing attribute information affects the choice of

compromise option. Parallel to past studies which suggest that

choice justification increases the compromise effect, we find an

increase in the effect when consumers are prompted to make

explicit inferences about the missing attributes.

Our findings have important theoretical implications for defining

and understanding the mechanism that underlies the compromise

effect. We discuss various practical implications for marketers},

 abstract = {Since the introduction of Red Bull in Austria in 1987 and in the United States in 1997, the energy drink market has grown exponentially. Hundreds of different brands are now marketed, with caffeine content ranging from a modest 50 mg to an alarming 505 mg per can or bottle. Regulation of energy drinks, including content labeling and health warnings differs across countries, with some of the most lax regulatory requirements in the U.S. The absence of regulatory oversight has resulted in aggressive marketing of energy drinks, targeted primarily toward young males, for psychoactive, performance-enhancing and stimulant drug effects. There are increasing reports of caffeine intoxication from energy drinks, and it seems likely that problems with caffeine dependence and withdrawal will also increase. In children and adolescents who are not habitual caffeine users, vulnerability to caffeine intoxication may be markedly increased due to an absence of pharmacological tolerance. Genetic factors may also contribute to an individual's vulnerability to caffeine-related disorders including caffeine intoxication, dependence, and withdrawal. The combined use of caffeine and alcohol is increasing sharply, and studies suggest that such combined use may increase the rate of alcohol-related injury. Several studies suggest that energy drinks may serve as a gateway to other forms of drug dependence. Regulatory implications concerning labeling and advertising, and the clinical implications for children and adolescents are discussed.},

@article{Smith.2009,
 abstract = {Deception of research participants is a pervasive ethical issue in experimental consumer research. Content analyses find as many as three-fourths of published human participant studies in our field involved some form of deception, almost all of which employed experimental methodologies. However, researchers have little guidance on the acceptability of the use of deception, notwithstanding the codes of root disciplines. We turn to theories of moral philosophy and use social contract theory specifically to identify conditions under which deception may be justified as morally permissible. Seven guiding principles for research practice are formulated and their implications for consumer researchers are identified, together with practical recommendations for decision making on studies involving deception.



Deceit is the intentional effort to mislead people. Whether it is morally justifiable is a question of crucial importance because it is a way of making people act against their will and the most common reason for distrust (Bok, 1992 and Darke and Ritchie, 2007, February). Lying, which involves falsehoods that are intended to deceive, is considered morally problematic by virtually all major philosophical traditions and religions. Yet the use of deception in experimental consumer research is a pervasive practice that appears to have reached a `taken-for-granted' status. Consumer researchers often deem it necessary to disguise their investigations to minimize demand characteristics and hypothesis guessing (Shimp, Hyatt, {\&} Snyder, 1993), and thus find themselves having to decide whether or not to lie to their participants (deception by commission or ``active deception''), or to omit pertinent information (deception by omission or ``passive deception''). But the argument can be made that deception in research is never morally justifiable (Bok, 1978).



Codes of the root disciplines, such as the American Psychological Association (APA) code, provide uncertain guidance on the use of deception and are not grounded in theories of moral philosophy (Kimmel, 2007 and Pittenger, 2002). Considerable attention has been given to deceptive marketing practices (Aditya, 2001, Darke and Ritchie, 2007, February and Tybout and Zaltman, 1974), but few studies present a formal ethical analysis. Studies that have applied normative theories of ethics to deception in research (Atwell, 1981, Baumrind, 1985, Kimmel and Smith, 2001, Pittenger, 2002, Reynolds, 1982 and Toy et al., 2001) generally do not develop sufficiently detailed analysis and prescriptions to offer specific guidance for experimental consumer research. This paper, in contrast, while building on these studies, applies from first principles social contract theory (SCT), a prominent theory of normative ethics increasingly found in business ethics (e.g., Bailey and Spicer, 2007, Dunfee et al., 1999 and Dunfee, 2006). SCT is used to identify guidelines to govern the use of deception and to provide specific, well-grounded and practical recommendations for consumer researchers. We do not call for the prohibition of deception (as is the case in economics research), but argue for careful evaluation of the circumstances under which it is acceptable, grounding our analysis in theories of moral philosophy as the source of the best-justified standards for ethical evaluation.},

 abstract = {The relationship between laboratory and field ratings was investigated for six different appetizers, including four ready-to-reconstitute mixes and two ready-to-eat munches. Liking ratings on a 5-point hedonic scale were obtained from an Indian Army field study at base level as well as at an altitude of 11,500 ft above sea level and for the same appetizers in the laboratory. The field trials of the six products were conducted in two phases and results revealed that the products were more acceptable at altitude, with increased liking scores as compared to base level. Subjective ratings for hunger revealed that at altitude, appetizer consumption had stimulated the appetite of the soldiers. The ability of laboratory ratings to predict acceptability of foods consumed under realistic conditions appears to depend on the convenience of the appetizer as well as the environmental conditions and the psycho-physiological status of the participants. The appetizers received higher ratings at altitude because of the pungent and spicy nature of appetizer mixes as compared with base field and laboratory conditions. However, for all the appetizers the pungent and sweet taste of the appetizer munches was highly preferred.},

 abstract = {Current National Health Service (NHS) policy places importance on allowing patients to choose the time and location of their treatment. However, existing evidence suggests that older people have distinct needs and preferences from those of the general population. This study aimed to elicit preferences over cataract surgery from older people using a stated preference experiment. In order to reduce the cognitive load of the experiment, a binary choice format (accept treatment, reject treatment) was used. Analysis suggests that the strongest determinant of whether or not to accept treatment may be whether or not a consultant performs the operation. In monetary equivalents, a one mile increase in travel and a 1 week increase in waiting time are both valued at approximately 2 pounds, whilst consultant-led care is valued at approximately 25 pounds. Whilst the majority of our sample ultimately selected the closest treatment location available the results here suggest that older people are able to make trade-offs between pertinent attributes of choice. Here, the closest treatment location may simply be the one that best reflects their preferences.},

@article{Murphy.2009b,
 abstract = {Risky decision-making involves weighing good and bad outcomes

against their probabilities in order to determine the relative

values of candidate actions. Although human decision-making

sometimes conforms to rational models of how this weighting

is achieved, irrational (or nonnormative) patterns of risky choice,

including shifts between risk-averse and risk-seeking choices involving

equivalent-value gambles (the ``reflection effect''), are

frequently observed. In the present experiment, we investigated

the role of serotonin in decision-making under conditions of

uncertainty. Fifteen healthy adult volunteers received a treatment

of 3 g per day of the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, in

the form of dietary supplements over a 14-day period, whereas

15 age- and IQ-matched control volunteers received a matched

placebo substance. At test, all participants completed a risky

decision-making task involving a series of choices between two

simultaneously presented gambles, differing in the magnitude

of their possible gains, the magnitude of their possible losses,

and the probabilities with which these outcomes were delivered.

Tryptophan supplements were associated with alterations in

the weighting of gains and small losses perhaps reflecting reduced

loss-aversion, and a marked and significant diminution of

the reflection effect. We conclude that serotonin activity plays

a significant role in nonnormative risky decision-making under

conditions of uncertainty.},

 abstract = {Two processes have been identified as governing decoy and compromise

effects in decision making: The value shift process suggests that

the decoy influences the cognitive evaluation of the target or the

competitor in terms of their perceived attribute values. The value

added process postulates that the decoy provides an increment in

value for the target because the presence of the decoy helps justify

the choice of the target over the competitor. Several theories for

explaining such value shifts are analyzed and then tested in an

experimental setting. The results are surprising and contradict

traditional assumptions, since a negative value shift is established

for the target relative to the competitor. Furthermore, there are

clear indications that value shift and value added processes operate

simultaneously and may compensate for one another. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley

 abstract = {Consumer choices are a result of an interplay of two systems: fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) and more deliberative reasoning (System 2). The present research examines the implication of the interplay between the two systems for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of resource depletion. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to one underlying resource used in self-regulation and decision-making, this paper demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choices. Specifically, we demonstrate that resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive System 1 influences by impairing the effortful and deliberate overriding role of System 2. In five experiments, we find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, magnifies the attraction effect, and increases choice deferral. The results shed light on both the mechanism underlying context effects on choices and the scope of the depleted resource.},

@article{Evans.2008,
 abstract = {This article reviews a diverse set of proposals for dual processing in higher cognition within largely disconnected literatures in cognitive and social psychology. All these theories have in common the distinction between cognitive processes that are fast, automatic, and unconscious and those that are slow, deliberative, and conscious. A number of authors have recently suggested that there may be two architecturally (and evolutionarily) distinct cognitive systems underlying these dual-process accounts. However, it emerges that (a) there are multiple kinds of implicit processes described by different theorists and (b) not all of the proposed attributes of the two kinds of processing can be sensibly mapped on to two systems as currently conceived. It is suggested that while some dual-process theories are concerned with parallel competing processes involving explicit and implicit knowledge systems, others are concerned with the influence of preconscious processes that contextualize and shape deliberative reasoning and decision-making.},

@article{Fensli.2008,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

This project focuses on how patients respond to wearable biomedical sensors, since patient acceptance of this type of monitoring technology is essential for enhancing the quality of the data being measured. There is a lack of validated questionnaires measuring patient acceptance of telemedical solutions, and little information is known of how patients evaluate the use of wearable sensors.

METHODS

In information systems research, surveys are commonly used to evaluate the user satisfaction of software programs. Based on this tradition and adding measures of patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a Sensor Acceptance Model is developed. The model is made operational using two questionnaires developed for measuring the patients' perceived acceptance of wearable sensors.

RESULTS

The model is tested with 11 patients using a newly developed wearable ECG sensor, and with 25 patients in a reference group using a traditional {\textquotedbl}Holter Recorder{\textquotedbl}. Construct validity is evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis, and internal consistency is calculated using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Sensor Acceptance Index (SAI) is calculated for each patient, showing reasonable dependencies and variance in scores.

CONCLUSIONS

This study attempts to identify patients' acceptance of wearable sensors, describing a user acceptance model. Understanding the patients' behavior and motivation represents a step forward in designing suitable technical solutions, and calculations of SAI can, hopefully, be used to compare different wearable sensor solutions. However, this instrument needs more extensive testing with a broader sample size, with different types of sensors and by explorative follow-up interviews.},

@article{Ferre.2008,
 abstract = {There has been a long debate about the predominant involvement of the different adenosine receptor subtypes and the preferential role of pre- versus post-synaptic mechanisms in the psychostimulant effects of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine. Both striatal A(1) and A(2A) receptors are involved in the motor-activating and probably reinforcing effects of caffeine, although they play a different role under conditions of acute or chronic caffeine administration. The present review emphasizes the key integrative role of adenosine and adenosine receptor heteromers in the computation of information at the level of the striatal spine module (SSM). This local module is mostly represented by the dendritic spine of the medium spiny neuron with its glutamatergic and dopaminergic synapses and astroglial processes that wrap the glutamatergic synapse. In the SSM, adenosine acts both pre- and post-synaptically through multiple mechanisms, which depend on heteromerization of A(1) and A(2A) receptors among themselves and with D(1) and D(2) receptors, respectively. A critical aspect of the mechanisms of the psychostimulant effects of caffeine is its ability to release the pre- and post-synaptic brakes that adenosine imposes on dopaminergic neurotransmission by acting on different adenosine receptor heteromers localized in different elements of the SSM.},

@article{GarciaLacalle.2008,
 abstract = {Freedom of hospital choice has become a popular policy among the European public health services to ensure better patient rights, reduce waiting times and improve efficiency and quality in public hospitals. The English National Health Service has recently adopted this policy. This organisation needs to introduce important reforms in order to implement this policy, in particular in the information that it provides to patients. This paper presents the Andalusian Health Service (SAS) initiative in the disclosure of information, based on patient surveys, so it can be understood by patients. Andalusia implemented a freedom of choice policy 10 years ago. This paper also studies how SAS hospitals are scored by patients and how the quality of hospitals may affect their choice. Regression analyses indicate that two hospital dimensions, a 'human dimension' and a 'facilities dimension', significantly explain how patients assess the quality of the Andalusian hospitals. Nonetheless, these two dimensions do not explain the reputation of the hospitals, a main aspect when choosing a hospital, to the same extent. The lessons provided by looking at the SAS experience may give an insightful knowledge on whether patients in England will finally opt for the best hospitals.},

Thus, we demonstrate a counterintuitive result: A common bias in individual decision making can help players to coordinate their decisions to obtain efficient outcomes. Further, limited steps of thinking alone cannot account for the observed asymmetric dominance effect. The effect appears to be due to increased psychological attractiveness of the dominating strategy, with our estimates of the incremen-tal attractiveness ranging from 3{\%}-6{\%}.

willingness to trade off attributes. The authors argue that this is not

necessarily the case. Instead, they show that when people learn

preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a

trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy),

they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose

the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent

preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets

containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective

attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across

contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference

construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat

purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The

authors show that this ``preference'' might just be a learned solution to the

choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes

often select the compromise choice. Since the compromise effect of

the middle option stems from the relational properties of the choice

alternatives, an information format compatible with their characteristics

makes the middle option more salient and attractive. Focusing

on three studies, this article demonstrates that the middle option is

(1) more attractive when presented in the middle position; (2) more

attractive when information is presented jointly rather than separately;

and (3) most attractive when presented in an information

display board format, less attractive in a list by attribute condition,

and least attractive in a list by alternative condition. These findings

imply that information processing strategies and information

format-option characteristics compatibility work in tandem. These

three studies thereby show that the information format-option

characteristics compatibility effect is robust and that such compatibility

effect is not due to different information processing strategies,

which makes these results meaningful for marketing practice.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine which attributes are important when individuals choose between primary care models. In particular, we studied whether individuals that were given a choice preferred individual family physicians (GP) or a primary care team consisting of physicians and nurses (PCT). METHOD: A questionnaire survey, designed as a discrete choice experiment, was sent to 1600 individuals in Sweden. In the questionnaire, different primary care models were constructed on the basis of five attributes: GP versus primary care team, waiting time for non-emergency visits, user charges, ability to choose provider, and degree of influence over the care received. Individual preferences and willingness to pay for attributes were regressed against such characteristics as age, gender, education, and health status (as measured by EQ-5D). RESULTS: The response rate was 58{\%}. Waiting time, user charges, ability to choose provider, and degree of influence over the care received were each statistically significant discriminants (p{\textless}0.001). Willingness to pay per visit was 224 SEK for great compared to limited degree of influence over the care received, 164 SEK for ability to choose a provider and 111 SEK for each 1 day reduction in waiting time for non-emergency visits. Subgroup analysis showed that older individuals and individuals in poor health preferred the option to register with a GP whereas working individuals and individuals living at a greater distance from a hospital preferred the option to register with a primary care team.},

As a brief perusal of any marketing textbook (or journal) indicates, we have developed approaches for solving important managerial problems. Consumer behavior, sales management, and advertising have been distinct fields of study, within marketing, for more than 40 years. There are specialized journals for each of these areas, butJAMS, as a general journal, also publishes scholarly articles in these areas. Nonetheless, each of these subdisciplines has its own unique set of patterns and traditions, and there does not appear to be a lot of communication between scholars who specialize in distinct subareas. In this way, we have a tendency to remain somewhat isolated as researchers and scholars. At the same time, there is an increasing challenge to fit all of marketing scholarship under one unified and harmonious tent.},

 abstract = {Choosing a consumer test methodology is critical for any company sensory scientist. However, we lack tools for comparing the outcome of consumer tests. Here we intended to develop a new comparison criterion based on a concept borrowed from metrology: robustness. We tested this concept with hedonic ratings data obtained from a central location test (CLT) on one hand and from a home use test (HUT) on the other hand. Two fermented milk beverages were tested and both tests were conducted with 240 subjects. The beverages differed in fat and sugar content. The comparison of the CLT and HUT data sets (both in monadic sequential) indicates that the method has a significant effect on the degree of liking. Indeed, the liking scores are lower with CLT than with HUT. Still, both tests lead to the same conclusion that the product with the higher fat and sugar content is significantly more liked. Besides, we developed three graphic representations that illustrate the results stability faced with the decrease in the panel size. These graphs show that CLT yields more robust results than HUT. Additionally the leading role of the panel size is emphasised for both tests. Our data show that the results from the two methods may change as soon as 20 subjects are removed from our original data set. These results that were not unexpected illustrate a fact which is often underestimated in practice.},

Between 9:00 p.m. and 2:59 a.m. of the next day, when most assaults occurred, there was a positive linear relationship between temperature and assault.

values) shift the values they espouse depending on cues such as language. The authors examined

whether the effects of language extend to a potentially less malleable domain, behavioral

decisions, exploring the extent to which bilingual individuals shift the underlying

strategies used to resolve choice problems. Although past research has explained language-

induced shifts in terms of knowledge accessibility principles, the motivation to conform

to observers'norms can also drive these shifts. This article focuses on shifts in the general strategy

of avoiding losses rather than pursuing gains, which is more often exhibited by Chinese

than byWesterners. Five studies of Hong Kong bicultural individuals found that language manipulation

(Cantonese vs. English) increases tendencies to choose compromise options in a

product decision task, endorse associated decision guidelines that advocate moderation as opposed

to extreme paths, defer decision making in problems where it can be postponed, and endorse

decision guidelines that advocate caution rather than decisive action. A motivational explanation

of these effects was confirmed.},

Under this view, the role of touch as a persuasive tool is limited. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the persuasive influence of touch as an affective tool in the absence of useful product-related information. The authors find that for people who are motivated to touch because it is fun or interesting, a communication that incorporates touch leads to increased affective response and increased persuasion, particularly when the touch provides neutral or positive sensory feedback. People who are not motivated to touch for fun will also be persuaded by a communication that incorporates touch when they are able to make sense of how the touch is related to the message. The authors explore the effectiveness of different types of touch in generating an affective response, and they replicate the effects on attitudes and behavior in a real-world setting. This research suggests that the marketing implications of touch are more substantial than previously believed.

That is, consumers value an identical economic value as a price or as a sum of money differently depending on their individual characteristics, price presentation characteristics, monetary form characteristics, and the consumer context due to subjectivity in their: Perception (biases in assessing the subjective value of money and prices); Inferences (whether consumers use price information to make other judgments); affect (the feelings and emotions associated with spending and saving); memory (errors and biases in recall of money and prices); and information integration (the manner in which consumers integrate costs and benefits to make decisions of whether, when, how much, and what to spend on).},

As predicted, the established identity fared better. The difference in buyers' willingness-to-pay was 8.1{\%} of the selling price. A subsidiary experiment followed the same format, but compared sales by relatively new sellers with and without negative feedback.

 abstract = {Although popular belief holds that vision dominates human experience, this does not necessarily imply that people regard vision as the most important sensory modality during the interaction with every product. Instead, the relative importance of the different modalities is likely to depend on the type of product and on the task performed. In Study 1, respondents reported how important they found vision, audition, touch, taste, and smell during the use of 45 different products. In Study 2, the respondents answered a similar question for the evaluation of the safety, ease of use, and enjoyment experienced for 15 products. Importance ratings for the sensory modalities differed considerably between the products. Differences due to the types of evaluations were smaller. Averaged over products and evaluation types, vision was the most important sensory modality for product evaluations, followed by touch, smell, audition, and taste. However, for about half of the individual products, the importance ratings for vision were lower than for one of the other modalities. These findings are in line with the view that vision is regarded the dominant modality, because it plays an important part in many and an irrelevant part in virtually no product experiences.},

For scales with a lower and upper bound, a suitable candidate for models is the beta distribution, which is very flexible and models skew quite well. The authors present maximum-likelihood regression models assuming that the dependent variable is conditionally beta distributed rather than Gaussian. The approach models both means (location) and variances (dispersion) with their own distinct sets of predictors (continuous and/or categorical), thereby modeling heteroscedasticity. The location sub-model link function is the logit and thereby analogous to logistic regression, whereas the dispersion sub-model is log linear. Real examples show that these models handle the independent observations case readily. The article discusses comparisons between beta regression and alternative techniques, model selection and interpretation, practical estimation, and software.},

with no consumption consequences for the participants, the extent to

which the studies are able to uncover ``true'' consumer preference struc-

tures is questionable. Experimental economics literature, with its empha-

sis on incentive alignment and hypothetical bias, suggests that more

realistic incentive-aligned studies result in stronger out-of-sample predic-

tive performance of actual purchase behaviors and provide better esti-

mates of consumer preference structures than do hypothetical studies.

To

test this hypothesis, the authors design an experiment with conven-

tional (hypothetical) conditions and parallel incentive-aligned counter-

parts. Using Chinese dinner specials as the context, the authors conduct

a field experiment in a Chinese restaurant during dinnertime. The results

provide strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice conjoint

analysis, in that incentive-aligned choice conjoint outperforms hypotheti-

cal choice conjoint in out-of-sample predictions. To determine the robust-

ness of the results, the authors conduct a second study that uses snacks

as the context and considers only the choice treatments. This study con-

firms the results by providing strong evidence in favor of incentive-

aligned choice analysis in out-of-sample predictions. The results provide

a strong motivation for conjoint practitioners to consider conducting stud-

ies in realistic settings using incentive structures that require participants

to ``live with'' their decisions.},

Clinical perspectives treat it as a psychiatric disorder, whereas recent proposals emphasize the increasing endorsement of materialistic values as a cause of uncontrolled buying (e.g. Dittmar, 2004b; Kasser {\&} Kanner, 2004). The present research aims to improve understanding of compulsive buying through examining gender, age, and endorsement of materialistic values as key predictors in three UK questionnaire studies, which sampled individuals who had contacted a self-help organization and residentially matched 'controls' (N = 330), consumer panelists from a multinational corporation (N = 250), and 16- to 18-year-old adolescents (N = 195). The results confirmed previously documented gender differences, and showed that younger people are more prone to compulsive buying. The central findings were that materialistic value endorsement emerged as the strongest predictor of individuals' compulsive buying, and that it significantly mediated the observed age differences.},

This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of hypothetical bias in 28 stated preference valuation studies that report monetary willingness-to-pay and used the same mechanism for eliciting both hypothetical and actual values. The papers generated 83 observations with a median ratio of hypothetical to actual value of only 1.35, and the distribution has severe positive skewness. We find that a choice-based elicitation mechanism is important in reducing bias. We provide some evidence that the use of student subjects may be a source of bias, but since this variable is highly correlated with group experimental settings, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. There is some weak evidence that bias increases when public goods are being valued, and that some calibration methods may be effective at reducing bias. However, results are quite sensitive to model specification, which will remain a problem until a comprehensive theory of hypothetical bias is developed.},

The authors propose a dual-process model of somatosensory experiences to account for the findings. In line with the model, the findings suggest that the ultimate pleasure that a consumer derives from the taste of a food sample depends on two components, an informational component and an affective component. Furthermore, the findings suggest that distraction affects the subsequent choice of the sampled item by increasing (decreasing) the impact of the affective component (informational component) on subsequent choice.},

When participants reported their preferences immediately after being exposed to the information

they provided for choosing the target over the competitor. (That is, a decoy had an impact if and

only if the target was superior to the decoy but the competitor was not.) When participants evaluated

each product individually before making their choices, however, they based their preferences

on these evaluations. In this case, decoys exerted their influence through their impact on

the values that participants assigned to the attributes on which the evaluations were based. This

influence was evident even when the decoy was clearly inferior to both the target and competitor.

Moreover, it occurred under conditions in which the target and competitor were in different

product categories and also when the decoy was in a totally different product domain than the

This work stimulated interest in pursuing the brain mechanisms of emotion in humans. Here, we review research on the role of the amygdala in emotional processes in both animal models and humans. The review is not exhaustive, but it highlights five major research topics that illustrate parallel roles for the amygdala in humans and other animals, including implicit emotional learning and memory, emotional modulation of memory, emotional influences on attention and perception, emotion and social behavior, and emotion inhibition and regulation.},

 abstract = {When people interact with products, all sensory modalities are open to receive information. To assess each modality's potential contribution to overall product experiences, we developed a split-modality approach, in which subjects experienced real-life products through only one modality: vision, touch, audition, or olfaction. Responses focused on (1) description of the sensory experience, (2) product identification, and (3) descriptions of associations and memories linked to this experience. Visual and tactual information were most detailed, made product identification easiest, and yielded the clearest memories of past events, associations to persons, and associations with other products. Because vision may have an advantage over touch by the speed with which information is processed, vision is likely to dominate product experiences in real-life situations.},

A 2 (no scent vs. Christmas scent)2 (non-Christmas music vs. Christmas music) experimental design was implemented in a mock retail

store. Results indicate that the effects of adding an ambient Christmas scent are moderated by the nature of the background music. In

particular, consumers' evaluations are more favorable when the Christmas scent is in the presence of Christmas music. The presence of the

Christmas scent with non-Christmas music, however, lowers evaluations. Results and implications of the findings are discussed with regard

In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour.},

The author will show that CRT scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability---an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive {\textquotedbl}style.{\textquotedbl} The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences.

@article{Graaf.2005,
 abstract = {The relationship between laboratory and field data was investigated for nine different groupings of 5-7 foods: two main dish groupings, four snack item groupings, and three specific meals. Liking ratings on the nine-point hedonic scale were obtained in an US Army field study and for the same foods in a sensory laboratory. In a subsequent choice simulation laboratory with two food groupings, we offered subjects some choice (three out of six or seven items) among to which foods they would evaluate. The results showed high correlations between lab and field ratings for the snack food groupings (0.58-0.94), but low correlations for the main dishes (-0.05-0.26) and meal components (-0.07-0.41). Correlations between mean field and mean laboratory data improved when laboratory subjects were offered a choice of foods. The ability of laboratory ratings to predict acceptability of foods consumed under realistic conditions appears to depend on the type of food, and may be better for foods used as snacks than for main dishes. Laboratory conditions in which subjects had some degree of choice among foods improved the relationship with the field data. It is important to pay more attention to experimental variables that may improve the validity of sensory laboratory tests.},

In a first phase, pictures of different brands of yogurts (CSs) were contingently presented with a positive or negative odor (US). In a subsequent phase, the yogurt CSs were used as primes in an affective priming procedure. Rating data showed that the acquisition procedure resulted in a reliable evaluative learning effect. This could be corroborated by the results of the priming task. Participants responded faster to positive target words and made fewer errors when they were preceded by a CS that had been associated with a positive odor, as compared to a CS that was associated with a negative odor. A reversed pattern was present for negative targets. Based on these findings, it is suggested that affective priming might be used as a demand-free measure of evaluative learning.},

These hypotheses were contrasted using attraction effect tasks in two different domains: earning extra credit in a course and grocery shopping, domains presumed to be of different levels of knowledge to younger and older adults. Older adults showed consistent choice for both domains; younger adults showed consistent choice only for the extra credit problem.

@article{Schifferstein.2007,
 abstract = {To determine the roles that the sensory modalities play in user product interactions, one modality was blocked during the execution of eight simple tasks. Participants reported how they experienced the products and how they felt during the experiment. Blocking vision resulted in the largest loss of functional information, increased task difficulty and task duration, and fostered dependency. On the other hand, the other senses were used more and product experiences increased in perceived intenseness. When touch was blocked, the perceived loss of information was smaller and participants reported that familiar products felt less like their own. Blocking audition resulted in communication problems and a feeling of being cut off. Blocking olfaction mainly decreased the intenseness of the experience. These outcomes suggest that vision mainly plays a functional role in everyday user-product interactions, whereas the main role for olfaction lies in the affective domain. Sensory impairments change the way people experience products. Blocking a single modality during everyday tasks gives insight into the impact of impairments. These insights can be used to develop products for multiple user groups (inclusive design) or products used under extreme environmental conditions.},

 abstract = {Consumer behavior research has a long history indicating that preferences are

influenced by the relative positions of members of a choice set. The realismof this work,

however, is somewhat limited because alternatives are typically labeled with letters

rather than with real brand names. We investigate the boundaries of prior research by

testing whether preferences for alternatives in compromise and superior positions

generalize to a more realistic market scenario that includes choices between real brands.

In particular, we conduct two studies that examine if preferences for brands in a choice

set are moderated by the inclusion of more or less familiar brand names. We find that

consumers prefer extreme brands when compromise brands are relatively less familiar

and compromise brands when they are relatively more familiar. In this scenario brand

familiarity and not the position of the alternatives determine choice. In situations where

a choice alternative is superior, we find no moderation due to brand familiarity},

@article{Smith.2007,
 abstract = {Two studies were conducted to examine the impact of subjective uncertainty on conformity to group norms in the attitude-behaviour context. In both studies, subjective uncertainty was manipulated using a deliberative mindset manipulation (McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, {\&} Spencer, 2001). In Study 1 (N=106), participants were exposed to either an attitude-congruent or an attitude-incongruent in-group norm. In Study 2 (N=83), participants were exposed to either a congruent, incongruent, or an ambiguous in-group norm. Ranges of attitude-behaviour outcomes, including attitude-intention consistency and change in attitude-certainty, were assessed. In both studies, levels of group-normative behaviour varied as a function of uncertainty condition. In Study 1, conformity to group norms, as evidenced by variations in the level of attitude-intention consistency, was observed only in the high uncertainty condition. In Study 2, exposure to an ambiguous norm had different effects for those in the low and the high uncertainty conditions. In the low uncertainty condition, greatest conformity was observed in the attitude-congruent norm condition compared with an attitude-congruent or ambiguous norm. In contrast, individuals in the high uncertainty condition displayed greatest conformity when exposed to either an attitude-congruent or an ambiguous in-group norm. The implications of these results for the role of subjective uncertainty in social influence processes are discussed.},

@article{Vag.2007,
 abstract = {In general, the integration of different modeling philosophies is a successful enterprise. This paper presents a concept that integrates two approaches, conjoint analysis and multi-agent simulation. The concept also employs some notions of social network analysis, consumer behavior modeling, and word-of-mouth marketing. These methods are self-complimentary: for example, conjoint analysis may serve as a perfect tool to supply multi-agent models with behavioral data, while multi-agent simulation offers dynamics to the static results of conjoint analysis. The idea of dynamic conjoint modeling is based on the assumption that one can predict an individual's purchases on the basis of his/her measured product preferences, communication habits and market behavior attributes. Dynamic conjoint modeling involves a simulated series of conjoint analyses executed by means of each time-step. This paper outlines a market model to simulate the association between consumers' communication and sales.},

These online environments could potentially be unique research platforms for the social sciences and clinical therapy, but it is crucial to first establish that social behavior and norms in virtual environments are comparable to those in the physical world. In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance (IPD), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of IPD and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: (1) male-male dyads have larger IPDs than female-female dyads, (2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and (3) decreases in IPD are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

 abstract = {Consumer behavior research involves various areas: psychology, marketing, sociology, economics and engineering. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) of consumer purchase decision-making. The core of this model is a motivation function that combines consumers' psychological personality traits with two important kinds of interactions in a competitive market. The model reveals the inner psychological mechanism on the basis of which consumers make their choices when facing competing brands on the market. By creating a large number of heterogeneous consumer agents in an artificial market, this study uses multi-agent simulation (MAS) to exhibit the emergent decoy effect phenomenon, which is a market dynamic phenomenon originating from the individual behavior of heterogeneous consumers and their interactions in the real-world complex market. The combined use of the ABM and the MAS method in studying consumer behavior and markets gives one the potential to cope with the dynamic changes and complexities in the real-world business environment.},

 abstract = {Recent reviews of synesthesia concentrate upon rare neurodevelopmental examples and exclude common olfactory-induced experiences with which they may profitably be compared. Like the neurodevelopmental synesthesias, odor-induced experiences involve different sensory modalities; are reliable, asymmetric (concurrents cannot induce), and automatic; and the inducer-concurrent relationship is learnt. Unlike neurodevelopmental synesthesias, these experiences are universal and their synesthetic nature goes unrecognized. Olfaction's ability to universally induce concurrents may result from its unique neuroanatomy, affording dual access to neocortex. We propose that concurrents arise here via a twofold process: by direct neocortical activation, which recovers a configural memory, and by attribution of this memory to the olfactory modality by thalamic attentional processes. The implications of this for other forms of synesthesia are then examined.},

choice sets, with half of the sets containing a phantom decoy in one of five possible

locations within the attribute space. Phantom decoy effects were robust across all decoy

locations but one, and the pattern of effects most closely corresponded to predictions of

the relative advantage model. Experiment 2 used a within-subjects manipulation of the

five phantom decoy locations. The overall pattern of effects most closely corresponded

to predictions from the relative advantage model, as did the pattern for the group of

participants who exhibited the strongest phantom decoy effects. Copyright},

A forced-choice triangle discrimination methodology was used to determine detection thresholds of caffeine in sweeteners and a cola beverage. The subjects (n=30, 28 female, 23+/-4 years old) were trained tasters and completed over 1600 discrimination tests during the study. The mean detection thresholds for caffeine in the sweet solutions were: 0.333+/-0.1mM sucrose; 0.467+/-0.29 mM aspartame; 0.462+/-0.3mM sucralose, well below the concentration in common cola beverages (0.55-0.67 mM). A fixed concentration of caffeine, corresponding to the concentration of caffeine in a common cola beverage (0.67 mM) was added to the sweeteners and a non-caffeinated cola beverage. Subjects could distinguish between caffeinated and non-caffeinated sweeteners (p{\textless}0.001), but all subjects failed to distinguish between caffeinated and non-caffeinated cola beverage (p=1.0).

 abstract = {It is widely accepted that unconscious processes can modulate judgments and behavior, but do such influences affect one's daily interactions with other people? Given that olfactory information has relatively direct access to cortical and subcortical emotional circuits, we tested whether the affective content of subliminal odors alters social preferences. Participants rated the likeability of neutral faces after smelling pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant odors delivered below detection thresholds. Odor affect significantly shifted likeability ratings only for those participants lacking conscious awareness of the smells, as verified by chance-level trial-by-trial performance on an odor-detection task. Across participants, the magnitude of this priming effect decreased as sensitivity for odor detection increased. In contrast, heart rate responses tracked odor valence independently of odor awareness. These results indicate that social preferences are subject to influences from odors that escape awareness, whereas the availability of conscious odor information may disrupt such effects.},

 abstract = {Binding various features of an event together and maintaining these connections in memory is an essential component of episodic memories. Previous theories make contradictory predictions about the effects of emotional arousal on memory binding. In this article, I review evidence for both arousal-impaired and arousal-enhanced memory binding and explain these contradictory findings using an object-based framework. According to this framework, emotionally arousing objects attract attention that enhances binding of their constituent features. In contrast, the emotional arousal associated with one object either impairs or has no effect on the associations between that object and other distinct objects or background contextual information. After initial encoding, the attention-grabbing nature of emotionally arousing objects can lead to interference in working memory, making it more difficult to maintain other bound representations. These contrasting effects of arousal on memory binding should help predict which aspects of emotional memories are likely to be accurate and which aspects are likely to be misremembered.},

influenced by preference fluency (i.e., the subjective feeling that forming

a preference for a specific option is easy or difficult). Four studies

manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting

descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to-read font (Study 1) or by asking

participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice (Studies

2--4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase

choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise

option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the

experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of decision conflict,

these effects are obtained without changing the attributes of the

alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or the reference points.

results},

The present research identifies 2 aspects of attitude certainty and provides evidence for the distinctness of the constructs. Specifically, it is proposed that attitude certainty can be conceptualized, and empirically separated, in terms of attitude clarity (the subjective sense that one knows what one's attitude is) and attitude correctness (the subjective sense that one's attitude is correct or valid). Experiment 1 uses factor analysis and correlational data to provide evidence for viewing attitude clarity and attitude correctness as separate constructs. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that attitude clarity and attitude correctness can have distinct antecedents (repeated expression and consensus feedback, respectively). Experiment 4 reveals that these constructs each play an independent role in persuasion and resistance situations. As clarity and correctness increase, attitudes become more resistant to counterattitudinal persuasive messages. These findings are discussed in relation to the existing attitude strength literature.},

@article{Gelman.2006,
 abstract = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary---for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1{\%} significance level to 4.9{\%}, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.



The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems---that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

However, research shows that subjects in a Vickrey auction do not always follow the dominant strategy of bidding their WTP but frequently bid too high or too low. While this phenomenon is usually attributed to irrational behavior, this need not be the only explanation. In marketing research applications subjects are typically asked their WTP for a new product, and it appears that most subjects are uncertain about their exact WTP. We present a modified bidding model to explain that in this case it is optimal for risk-averse but rational bidders to underestimate their WTP rather than to overestimate it.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have shown an involvement of the human cerebellum in motor learning, but little is known about the role of the cerebellum in learning of unspecific aversive reactions. The present study sought to distinguish which areas of the human cerebellum and brain-stem are involved in short-term habituation (STH) and long-term habituation (LTH) of the acoustic startle response. METHODS: On 5 consecutive days 42 acoustic startle stimuli were applied each day in 8 male healthy subjects. On the first and on the fifth day of the experiment [15O]H2O PET scans were performed. RESULTS: Electromyographic recordings revealed a significant decrease of the startle response within each day (STH) and across the 5 days of the experiment (LTH). On both days a decrease of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) across PET scans was found in the medial cerebellum most probably reflecting reduced sensory feedback during STH. Between days an increase of rCBF in the dorsomedial pons, in the mesencephalon and in an area of the medial cerebellum was observed. These activations may reflect increased inhibition of the startle response during LTH and correspond to previous animal lesion studies. Furthermore, during LTH an increase of rCBF within the lateral cerebellum in lobule HVI/Crus I was detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that distinct parts of the medial and lateral cerebellum are involved in habituation of the acoustic startle response. Lobule HVI/Crus I most likely plays a more general role in implicit learning processes considering its involvement in several conditioning paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study contribute to the understanding of cerebellar involvement in learning of unspecific aversive reactions.},

 abstract = {According to construal level theory (N. Liberman, Y. Trope, {\&} E. Stephan, in press; Y. Trope {\&} N. Liberman, 2003), people use a more abstract, high construal level when judging, perceiving, and predicting more psychologically distal targets, and they judge more abstract targets as being more psychologically distal. The present research demonstrated that associations between more distance and higher level of construal also exist on a pure conceptual level. Eight experiments used the Implicit Association Test (IAT; A. G. Greenwald, D. E. McGhee, {\&} J. L. K. Schwartz, 1998) to demonstrate an association between words related to construal level (low vs. high) and words related to four dimensions of distance (proximal vs. distal): temporal distance, spatial distance, social distance, and hypotheticality. In addition to demonstrating an association between level of construal and psychological distance, these findings also corroborate the assumption that all 4 dimensions of psychological distance are related to level of construal in a similar way and support the notion that they all are forms of psychological distance.},

creased efficiency, better mimic consumer choices, and allow one to model changes in  market size. However, when the no-choice option is selected no information is obtained on the relative attractiveness of the available alternatives. One potential solu- tion to this problem is to use a dual response format in which respondents first choose among a set of available alternatives in a forced-choice task and then choose among the available alternatives and a no-choice option.

This paper uses a simulation to demonstrate and confirm the possible gains in efficiency of dual response over traditional choice-based conjoint tasks when there are different proportions choosing the no-choice option. Next, two choice-based con- joint analysis studies find little systematic violation of IIA with the addition/deletion of a no-choice option. Further analysis supports the hypothesis that selection of the no-choice option is more closely related to choice set attractiveness than to decision},

In Experiment 1, we assessed the influence of olfactory cues on the tactile perception of fabric softness using computer-controlled stimulus presentation. The results showed that participants rated fabric swatches as feeling significantly softer when presented with a lemon odor than when presented with an animal-like odor, demonstrating that olfactory cues can modulate tactile perception. In Experiment 2, we assessed whether this modulatory effect varied as a function of the particular odors being used and/or of the spatial coincidence between the olfactory and tactile stimuli. The results replicated those reported in Experiment 1 thus further supporting the claim that people's rating of tactile stimuli can be modulated by the presence of an odor. Taken together, the results of the two experiments reported here support the existence of a cross-modal interaction between olfaction and touch.},

@article{Demonaco.2006,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To determine the role of clinicians in the discovery of off-label use of prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data Sources. Micromedex Healthcare Series was used to identify new uses of new molecular entities approved by the FDA in 1998, literature from January 1999-December 2003 was accessed through MEDLINE, and relevant patents were identified through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

DATA SYNTHESIS AND MAIN FINDING

A survey of new therapeutic uses for new molecular entity drugs approved in 1998 was conducted for the subsequent 5 years of commercial availability. During that period, 143 new applications were identified in a computerized search of the literature for the 29 new drugs considered and approved in 1998. Literature and patent searches were conducted to identify the first report of each new application. Authors of the seminal articles were contacted through an electronic survey to determine whether they were in fact the originators of the new applications. If they were, examination of article content and author surveys were used to explore if each new application was discovered through clinical practice that was independent of pharmaceutical company or university research (field discovery) or if the discovery was made by or with the involvement of pharmaceutical company or university researchers (central discovery). Eighty-two (57{\%}) of the 143 drug therapy innovations in our sample were discovered by practicing clinicians through field discovery.

CONCLUSION

To our knowledge, the major role of clinicians in the discovery of new, off-label drug therapies has not been previously documented or explored. We propose that this finding has important regulatory and health policy implications.},

The frequency of impulse purchasing for both toilet paper and coffee was very low (11.3 and 13.2{\%}, respectively). The best predictors of the degree of planning were task-related factors such as frequency of purchase, strength of product preference, search time, and package examination. Brand loyalty had the greatest overall influence. Price also was a strong predictor, and it was especially influential for partial planners (those with category but no brand intent). Compared to impulse and planned purchasers, partial purchasers rated the brand decision as less important and had less attitudinal and behavioral commitment to the chosen brand.},

A fundamental premise of the article is that these relationships are much more complex than a casual analysis would suggest. More specifically, though all of the research design variables and psychometric criteria are related at a conceptual level, there is no necessary relationship between many of the variables at an empirical level. Meta-analysis techniques are applied to 162 measures found in the marketing literature to examine the relationships among the research design choices of sampling characteristics, measure characteristics, and measure development processes and the various psychometric criteria of measure quality. The proposed model makes predictions for positive, negative, and no effects relationships. All of the hypotheses in the model except one are supported, with systematic variance apparently the common element producing correlations among the various indicants of measure quality. The primary conclusion is that researchers must pay much greater attention to non-empirical evidence when judging construct validity. Three recommendations are offered for measurement research in marketing.},

A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.},

A method is proposed for handling multiattribute judgment problems with a large number of attributes. Attributes are grouped a priori into logical, functional or other subsets. Subjects evaluate profiles of attributes in each subset. Responses to profiles in separate sets are linked by means of an overall experimental design which treats each subset as a factor whose levels are values of the response scale(s) used in each subset experiment. By concatenating the judgment equations from each subset with the equation for the overall design a single, closed-form judgment equation can be derived. An experimental test is provided.},

Using c2 as a measure of effect size, the investigation's results reveal that, on average, approximately 11 percent of the variance in a response variable was explained or accounted for by a statistically significant (p c 0.05) effect. This percentage, however, differed as a function of the methodological characteristics of the experiment.},

The results confirmed the findings of previous Monte Carlo studies on clustering procedures in that accuracy was inversely related to coverage, and that algorithms using correlation as the similarity measure were significantly more accurate than those using Euclidean distances. No evidence was found for the assumption that the positive effects of the use of correlation coefficients are confined to unconstrained mixture models.},

@article{Hass.1984,
 abstract = {Self-awareness theory assumes that individuals direct their attention outward or back on themselves as a function of characteristics of the situation. Taking this theory literally, it was hypothesized that Ss taking a self-focused perspective would draw a capital letter E on their forehead such that the E would be oriented for the external perspective of an observer. Ss' whose attention was directed outward would draw an E that would appear backward to another person. As hypothesized, in 3 experiments with 175 female undergraduates, Ss in high self-focus conditions significantly more often than low self-focus Ss drew an E on their forehead oriented toward the perspective of an outside observer, even though they believed they could not be observed by anyone else. Self-focus was induced using a video camera placed either to the side of the S (Exp I) or behind the S (Exp II), where it could not record how the E was drawn. In Exp III, an audiotape recorder was used to induce self-focused attention. The results demonstrate that an external, reflexive visual perspective could be induced by an auditory self-focusing manipulation. Furthermore, in Exp III, when situationally induced self-focus was low, Ss who were high in public self-consciousness (as measured by the Self-Consciousness Scale) were more likely to draw the E from an external perspective than were Ss low in public self-consciousness. Degree of private self-consciousness was unrelated to perspective taking.},

 abstract = {This is the core or basic paper in a symposium on the probability approach in psychology. The paper expands on earlier contentions of this author that the environment to which an organism must adjust is semierratic and that therefore all functional psychology is inherently probabilistic, demanding a representative research design of its own, and leading to a special type of high-complexity, descriptive theory. {\textquotedbl}The expansions beyond the earlier publications$\ldots$ concern mainly the use of a behavioral example$\ldots$ ; the brief consideration of such semirepresentative policies as 'canvassing'; certain comparisons with factorial design and the analysis of variance, as well as with non-functionalistic uses of probability in psychology; and a discussion of actual and potential applications to the clinical-social area and to related domains.{\textquotedbl} 53 references},

But how does one cope with the problem of unconscious influence? It is possible that a good many contradictory or unexpected findings are due to the fact that the experimenter unknowingly communicated his desires or expectations to his subjects. Though this problem has been generally recognized and much discussed, there has heretofore been no systematic test of the hypothesis that an experimenter can obtain from his subjects the data he expects or wants to obtain. This paper reports just such a test, and discusses what can be done to avoid experimenter influence, both conscious and unconscious.},

 abstract = {Many researchers rely on meta-analysis to summarize research evidence. However, there is a concern that publication bias and selective reporting may lead to biased meta-analytic effect sizes. We compare the results of meta-analyses to large-scale preregistered replications in psychology carried out at multiple laboratories. The multiple-laboratory replications provide precisely estimated effect sizes that do not suffer from publication bias or selective reporting. We searched the literature and identified 15 meta-analyses on the same topics as multiple-laboratory replications. We find that meta-analytic effect sizes are significantly different from replication effect sizes for 12 out of the 15 meta-replication pairs. These differences are systematic and, on average, meta-analytic effect sizes are almost three times as large as replication effect sizes. We also implement three methods of correcting meta-analysis for bias, but these methods do not substantively improve the meta-analytic results.},

@book{Sherif.1936,
 abstract = {Most experiments in social psychology are considered defective because the investigators, lacking social perspective, set up their problems within the culture of their own communities. The writer has no sympathy for the controversy between the individual and the social approaches. The individual is regarded as basic, and any valid psychological principle should apply to the individual, alone, in a group, or in relation to his whole culture. Throughout psychology, in perception, in judgment, in affectivity, etc., the frame of reference is shown to be an important determinant of experience. Variations in culture are shown to be variations in frames of reference common to various groups. Social frames of reference (social norms, i.e. values, customs, stereotypes, conventions, etc.) are regarded first as stimuli which meet the individual in his associations with others and then become interiorized. The process of establishing a social norm is illustrated experimentally in an unstable perceptual situation (autokinetic phenomenon). Observing alone, the individual establishes his own frame of reference, which is modified in the direction of conformity when he observes in a group. Observing first in a group, frames of reference are set up which determine subsequent reports when the individual observes alone (illustrating the factual basis for the contentions that supra-individual qualities arise in group situations). Social values in relation to personal needs are discussed in the light of this experiment. A final chapter describes {\textquotedbl}human nature{\textquotedbl} as dependent upon the norms peculiar to the individual's group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Some problems for attribution theory are considered, including the interplay between preconceptions and new information, simple vs. complex schemata, attribution of covariation among causes, and illusions in attributions. The role of attribution in decision making and behavior is discussed.},

The static-dynamic dimension is viewed as the degree to which these factors in the decision unit's environment remain basically the same over time or are in a continual process of change. Results indicate that individuals in decision units with dynamic-complex environments experience the greatest amount of uncertainty in decision making. The data also indicate that the static-dynamic dimension of the environment is a more important contributor to uncertainty than the simple-complex dimension},

@article{Jones.1971,
 abstract = {Considers that, if ss can be convinced that a physiological monitoring device is able to measure both the amplitude and direction of emotional response, their subsequent attempts to predict what the machine says about their attitudes should be uncontaminated by many of the biases that obscure paper-and-pencil measures. 4 experiments are described in which variations of this {\textquotedbl}bogus pipeline{\textquotedbl} paradigm were employed. In each case it proved quite possible to validate the device in the s's eyes and to extract theoretically meaningful estimation measures of interpersonal attraction. It is not clear whether the differences between such estimation measures and the standard verbal measures of attitude are based simply on a lie detection principle, on a principle of error preference, or on the fact that the affective component of a complex attitude has been made salient. For whatever reason or reasons, ss attached to the bogus device appear much more ready to express negative affect in experimental settings where one might normally expect the inhibition of such feelings, E.g., toward negroes and the physically handicapped.},

@article{Dhar.1996,
 abstract = {Recent research has examined consumer decision making when the option of not

choosing any of the alternatives is also provided. The findings from this research

suggest that the decision to defer choice is sensitive to the uncertainty of choosing

the most preferred option from the set of alternatives provided. Building on this

research, the author tests whether the decision to defer choice is also influenced by

task variables that influence decision uncertainty. In the first experiment, this

proposition is tested for choice problems in which information on three relatively

equally attractive alternatives is presented either sequentially or simultaneously.

As predicted, the preference for the defer-choice option was greater when the

three alternatives were presented simultaneously. A second study forced subjects

into using one of four decision strategies in order to choose between two nondominated

alternatives. The preference for the no-choice option was found to be

higher when the rule required explicit attribute tradeoffs and lower when it

simplified choice. These results suggest that choice uncertainty is influenced by the

decision strategy used to determine the preference among alternatives. We conclude

with a discussion of the implications of the results for marketers' communication

strategies.},

In this paper, we suggest that context-induced violations of invariance in preference and in similarity judgments are based on changes in the underlying cognitive representation. Using the case of attraction effect as our example, we demonstrate experimentally that (i) similarity or the distance between two brands changes as a function of new brand introduction and (ii) rather precise predictions can be made as to the pattern of changes in the distance between brands and changes in preference ordering. Furthermore, the effect of context on similarity judgment patterns allows us to identify new effects on preference for previously untested location of new brands, providing additional support for the claim that preference and similarity judgments involve common processes.},

Researchers have begun moving from descriptive studies of this phenomenon to attempts to explain some of its causal mechanisms. One possible explanation is that such behavior may serve as a way of self-medicating depression and negative affect for compulsive buyers. This study examines reported mood states prior to and during shopping for 24 compulsive buyers and a matched comparison group. The findings indicated that relative to the comparison group, the compulsive buyers reported feeling most of the mood states more frequently prior to going shopping, especially the more negative moods. Compulsive buyers also more frequently experienced extreme moods (both positive and negative), while shopping than did the comparison group. When within-subject differences were examined for preshopping and shopping moods, compulsive buyers were more likely to move from negative to positive moods, whereas the opposite was true for the comparison group. The findings suggest that compulsive buyers may be using buying behavior to manage undesirable mood states},

 abstract = {In recent years, researchers have recognized the importance of the concept of effect size for planning research, determining the significance of research results, and accumulating results across studies. However, the uncritical use of effect-size indicators may lead to different interpretations of similar research findings because of differences in assumptions underlying the nature of the research, aspects of the phenomenon being investigated, or the methodological characteristics of the research. This article reviews the substantive, measurement, and methodological issues that influence the relative magnitude of an empirical effect size. The relationships and transformations between different types of effect-size indicators are presented. It is the thesis of this article that the meaningfulness of an estimated effect size should be interpreted with consideration of the type of research (relational vs. experimental), the anticipated application of the results obtained (effects application vs. theory testing), and the research history in the domain of inquiry. Researchers must be cognizant of the many different causal factors that influence effect size before using the magnitude of an effect for assessing the importance of research results, calculating the statistical power of a test, or synthesizing findings across different studies.},

 abstract = {The process by which individuals make sequential searches among choice sets prior to choosing a single item is examined. Economic search theory prescribes that such searches should be made by focusing on expectations of the maximum utility likely to be found in each set, ignoring external features of sets such as their complexity. Empirical research in psychology, however, suggests that search behavior may be highly influenced by set features, most notably a tendency to defer choices from sets that are perceived as difficult to evaluate. An experimental investigation of choice-set search reveals that stopping decisions are indeed influenced by normatively irrelevant external features of sets, but not in a way that is completely consistent with previous work on context effects. In particular, we find that individuals are likely to stop sooner in search when encountering larger versus smaller choice sets (holding their maximum utilities constant), and decisions to stop are unaffected by two traditional measures of difficulty: whether a choice set lacks dominant options and the similarity of overall utilities of options in a set. Implications of the work for the ability to generalize findings in static choice to dynamic task settings are explored.},

The EM algorithm and its extensions, multiple imputation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo provide a set of flexible and reliable tools from inference in large classes of missing-data problems. Yet, in practical terms, those developments have had surprisingly little impact on the way most data analysts handle missing values on a routine basis. Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, making these missing-data tools accessible to a broad audience. It presents a unified, Bayesian approach to the analysis of incomplete multivariate data, covering datasets in which the variables are continuous, categorical, or both. The focus is applied, where necessary, to help readers thoroughly understand the statistical properties of those methods, and the behavior of the accompanying algorithms.All techniques are illustrated with real data examples, with extended discussion and practical advice. All of the algorithms described in this book have been implemented by the author for general use in the statistical languages S and S Plus. The software is available free of charge on the Internet.},

Such effects have been dubbed attraction effects and violate the principles of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and regularity. We report a metaanalysis that, in addition to revealing heretofore unsupported range effects, demonstrates an effect of brand quality Decoys reduce shares of lower-quality competitors more than they reduce shares of higher-quality competitors. Moreover, whereas IIA is violated throughout, regularity is violated only when higher-quality brands are targeted. Decoys increase shares of higher-quality brands but typically do not increase shares of lower-quality brands. To assess the generalizability of the meta-analytic pattern, we tested decoy effects on two distinct populations in a large experiment The more traditional population replicated the meta-analytic pattern (standard asymmetry) while the more nontraditional population reversed it. These findings suggest that while the standard asymmetry is replicable, it may not generalize to all market segments},

This phenomenon is generally looked at as a manifestation of deviations from rationality in choice. However, assuming full rationality, I describe a decision rule that is based on con-sumers' inferences about their personal valuation of alternatives from the portfolio of market offerings and some information about their own relative tastes. Through a number of examples, I will argue that consumers often use this or similar decision rules to make inferences about utility. I then show that the decision rule may generate compromise effects in experiments and that it may be sustainable. The compromise effect could therefore be seen as preliminary evidence that consumers make such inferences.},

@article{Ballard.1994,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Although the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) uses Medicare hospital mortality data as a measure of hospital quality of care, concerns have been raised regarding the validity of this concept. A problem that has not been fully evaluated in these data is the potential confounding effect of illness severity factors associated with referral selection and hospital mortality on comparisons of risk-adjusted hospital mortality. We address this issue. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. We analyzed the 1988 Medicare hospitalization data file (MEDPAR). We selected data on patients treated at the two Mayo Clinic-associated hospitals in Rochester, Minnesota, and a group of seven other hospitals that treat many patients from large geographic areas. These hospitals have had observed mortality rates substantially lower than those predicted by the HCFA model for the period 1987-1990. STUDY DESIGN. Using the multiple logistic regression model applied by HCFA to the 1988 data, we evaluated the relationship between distance from patient residence to the admitting hospital and risk-adjusted hospital mortality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Among patients admitted to Mayo Rochester-affiliated hospitals, residence outside Olmsted County, Minnesota was independently associated with a 33 percent lower 30-day mortality rate (p {\textless} .001) than that associated with residence in Olmsted County. When patients at Mayo hospitals were stratified by residence (Olmsted County versus non-Olmsted County), the observed mortality was similar to that predicted for community patients (9.6 percent versus 10.2 percent, p = .26), whereas hospital mortality for referral patients was substantially lower than predicted (5.0 percent versus 7.5 percent, p = {\textless} .001). After incorporation of the HCFA risk adjustment methods, distance from patient residence to the hospitals was also independently associated with mortality among the Mayo Rochester-affiliated hospitals and seven other referral center hospitals. CONCLUSIONS. The HCFA Medicare hospital mortality model should be used with extreme caution to evaluate hospital quality of care for national referral centers because of residual confounding due to severity of illness factors associated with geographic referral that are inadequately captured in the extant prediction model.},

Italian and British foods were offered in a British restaurant for four days. Foods were offered for 2 days under control conditions, when the restaurant was decorated as usual. The identical foods then were offered in the restaurant for 2 more days under experimental conditions, when ethnic names were used on the menu to describe foods, and the restaurant was decorated with an Italian theme. Perceived ethnicity and acceptability of items were rated by customers each day, and item selection was tracked. The Italian theme increased selection of pasta and dessert items, and decreased the selection of fish. The Italian theme also increased the perceived Italian ethnicity of British pasta items, fish and veal, and increased the perceived Italian ethnicity of the meal overall. These findings show that changes in perceived ethnicity and food selection can be accomplished without altering food items, but merely by manipulating the environment, and may imply a unique strategy for increasing perceived menu variety.},

(1) subjects choosing the higher-qua{\"u}ty brand prefer their brand

more than subjects choosing the !ower-qua!ity brand prefer theirs,

(2) adding a dominated brand increases the choice share of the

higher-quality brandbut not the lower-quality brand, and (3) adding

a brand dominated by the lower-qua{\"u}ty but not higher-qua{\"u}ty

brand can increase the higher-qua{\"U}ty brand's choice share if that

The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

@article{Myllykangas.1996,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate differences in attitudes concerning prioritisation in health care held by doctors, nurses, local politicians and the general public. METHODS: Four groups were established: a population sample of 2000 subjects, aged 18-70 years; a random sample of 1500 doctors of working age; a random sample of 1000 nurses of working age; and a sample of 2200 politicians involved in health and social care administration, mostly at the municipal level (altogether 6700 subjects). The main questionnaire contained, among other things, a list of 12 statements concerning ethical decisions regarding prioritisation in health care. Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each statement. RESULTS: Most respondents in all the groups felt able to express an opinion on the statements. Despite considerable professional and cultural differences between groups, the views were generally similar. On the whole, respondents supported liberal policies in which the community took responsibility for subsidising health care. When differences between groups occurred, it was usually the doctors who held discordant views. Doctors were less inclined to consider a patient's economic status as a determinant of priority for treatment than the other three groups. Both doctors and nurses were less punitive towards patients with self-induced diseases. And doctors and politicians were more likely to feel further cuts in health care expenditure were possible than was true for nurses and the public. CONCLUSIONS: While considerable uniformity of opinion exists on ethical issues of prioritisation between the principal interested parties, the views of doctors differ substantially on some matters. If prioritisation was left entirely to doctors, health care provision would not reflect the views of other groups in some important ways.},

 abstract = {Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and

households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities. Making

use of research on this topic over the past decade, this paper summarizes the

current state of our knowledge about how people engage in mental accounting

activities. Three components of mental accounting receive the most attention.

This first captures how outcomes are perceived and experienced, and how

decisions are made and subsequently evaluated. The accounting system provides

the inputs to be both ex ante and ex post cost-benefit analyses. A second component

of mental accounting involves the assignment of activities to specific

accounts. Both the sources and uses of funds are labeled in real as well as in

mental accounting systems. Expenditures are grouped into categories (housing,

food, etc.) and spending is sometimes constrained by implicit or explicit budgets.

The third component of mental accounting concerns the frequency with which

accounts are evaluated and 'choice bracketing'. Accounts can be balanced daily,

weekly, yearly, and so on, and can be defined narrowly or broadly. Each of the

components of mental accounting violates the economic principle of fungibility.

As a result, mental accounting influences choice, that is, it matters.},

Three recommendations are made for implementing these concerns: (1) consumer behavior articles should be required to have a section indicating how increased levels of external validity can be obtained with other studies, (2) ``joint ventures'' between consumer behavior and marketing science researchers can be profitable and should be encouraged, and (3) analyses of electronic scanner panel data or other secondary data can be used to generate higher levels of external validity. Three examples are given from the marketing literature of how findings from experiments and scanner data can be combined to advance a stream of research.},

In contexts without a visual cue, rating of fit showed an influence of implicitly learned memories of odor. The rating was not affected by the pleasantness of the odors.

Recent research, however, suggests that product assortment can play a key role, not only in satisfying wants, but also in influencing buyer wants and preferences. This article reviews and synthesizes empirical evidence indicating that (a) retailers can use the assortment subset that buyers consider to enhance the likelihood that a purchase will be made and to affect the specific option selected, (b) the manner in which the set of considered options are presented also affects buyer preferences and purchase decisions, and, (c) the effects of the considered options and presentation format interact with other elements of the marketing mix such as sales promotions. The implications of these findings for retailers, including ethical aspects of influencing buyer preferences, are discussed.},

This phenomenon, the attraction effect, is relevant to physician decision making, particularly when the physician is in the role of a consumer who must make decisions about prescribing medications when a number of alternatives are available. To investigate the attraction effect in physician decision making, 40 internal medicine residents reviewed three patient cases (concerning depression, sinusitis, and vaginitis) and then chose the most appropriate medication for each patient. In some versions of the cases, two medication options were available. Other versions included a third medication (the decoy) that was inferior in every way to one of the original options (the target) but not to the other (the competitor). The results showed that addition of the {\textquotedbl}decoy{\textquotedbl} medication increased the likelihood of choosing the target medication. That is, the attraction effect does occur in physicians' decisions about medications. Physicians should be aware of this bias when evaluating or suggesting several similarly attractive medications or treatment options for the same medical condition.},

Furthermore, data suggest that the amygdala enhances episodic memory in part through modulation of hippocampal activity. The human amygdala seems to modulate the strength of conscious memory for events according to emotional importance, regardless of whether the emotion is pleasant or aversive.},

asymmetric dominance effects. A choice experiment manipulates assortment composition,

prices, store ambience, competing store features, and purchase goal. In an application to

florist stores we find that in-store purchase decisions are affected by the size and

ambience. We find substitution effects between flowers of the same variety, but not for all

GA's used earlier in clustering employ either an expensive crossover operator to generate valid child chromosomes from parent chromosomes or a costly fitness function or both. To circumvent these expensive operations, we hybridize GA with a classical gradient descent algorithm used in clustering, viz. K-means algorithm. Hence, the name genetic K-means algorithm (GKA). We define K-means operator, one-step of K-means algorithm, and use it in GKA as a search operator instead of crossover. We also define a biased mutation operator specific to clustering called distance-based-mutation. Using finite Markov chain theory, we prove that the GKA converges to the global optimum. It is observed in the simulations that GKA converges to the best known optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result. It is also observed that GKA searches faster than some of the other evolutionary algorithms used for clustering.},

 abstract = {A traditional assumption concerning how prices influence buyers' purchasing behaviors has been that buyers know the prices of the products and services that they consider for purchase. However, empirical research during the past four decades repeatedly has discovered that buyers often are not able to remember the prices of items they had recently purchased. One conclusion that has been drawn is that buyers often do not attend to price information in purchase decisions. The authors argue that this conclusion may be incorrect in that what consumers can explicitly remember is not always a good indicator of what they implicitly know. Price information not consciously remembered can still influence internal reference prices and product evaluations. In this article, the authors discuss the conceptual and methodological ramifications of the distinction between remembering and knowing to reassess and refine our understanding of how buyers process and use price information.},

However, customer studies have generally focused on loyal customers and loyalty rather than on reasons for switching service providers. The aim of this article is to present a model for studying customers' switching behavior as processes by extending the Critical Incident Technique in a relationship direction. By using the new technique, an analytic framework was developed that identifies three different kinds of switching determinants: pushing determinants, pulling determinant, and swayers. The new technique captures the configurations of the underlying factors that lead to revocable or irrevocable switching decisions. The study shows that these configurations are signals of switching, which provide useful knowledge for management and staff for policy and training purposes.},

Theories of self-identity in post-industrial society propose that norms supporting impulse control and delay of gratification have weakened in favor of present-oriented expression of impulse. Previous research on socio-economic status, delay of gratification, unplanned and ``impulse'' buying is reviewed, and a conceptual model differentiating akratic impulse buying from compulsive impulse buying is proposed. Survey data from a US national sample of adults with a self-reported measure of impulse buying are analyzed and a logit model fit to the data. The results do not fit the middle-class delay of gratification model: Higher levels of impulse buying were found to be associated with ``some'' college (or other post high school) educational experience, controlling for age and gender; family income was not found to be related to impulse buying.},

@article{Brownlie.1997,
 abstract = {`Relevance' is a quality widely attributed to research that closes the gap between theory and practice. It is an attribute well worth attracting these days. For some marketing scholars and practitioners closing this gap has assumed the proportions of an heroic and perennial struggle between the high-mindedness of marketing theory and the low deeds of marketing practice. Many different perspectives are offered by way of an analysis of the origins of this particular species. Yet, despite our best efforts to the contrary, the beast continues to prosper and to defy understanding.



Through critically appraising the social location of marketing management and its ensuing rhetoric, this paper provides an alternative understanding of this gap and the `slings and arrows' we suffer in our quest to achieve the `Holy Grail' of closure. This understanding implicates the marketing academy in the perpetuation of the belief that the gap exists `out there' and that it should and can be closed. Controversially, we suggest that, despite the marketing academy's declared quest for `relevance' through providing clues to better marketing practice, perhaps it is in the academy's own interest to continue to perpetuate this particular marketing myth.



We argue that if this is so, then the marketing management discourse is in danger of being trapped in the aspic of its own prejudices. The paper maps out the contours of this danger.},

@article{Egger.1997,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses.

DESIGN

Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30{\%} of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision.

RESULTS

In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38{\%}) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13{\%}) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias.

CONCLUSIONS

A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

We propose that an alternative that requires more cognitive effort to evaluate leads the decision maker to generate more negative affect and to choose that alternative less frequently than an alternative that is less effortful to evaluate. Two studies demonstrate that when different levels of effort are expended processing equivalent alternatives, the effort adversely affects choice of the more difficult to process alternatives. More respondents, especially those with less skill at the evaluation task, selected a brand and expressed a greater willingness to pay a premium for it when it was less effortful to evaluate. The second study shows that more negative affect was generated as the cognitive effort increased, lowering the likelihood of the difficult alternative being selected. The extent of negative affect generated was exaggerated under time pressure and increased the choice of the less difficult alternative. Although negative affect was generated, it did not influence choice when there was a clearly superior alternative.},

@article{Gilmore.1997,
 abstract = {Virtually all executives today recognize the need to provide outstanding service to customers. Focusing on the customer, however, is both an imperative and a potential curse. In their desire to become customer driven, many companies have resorted to inventing new programs and procedures to meet every customer's request. But as customers and their needs grow increasingly diverse, such an approach has become a surefire way to add unnecessary cost and complexity to operations. Companies around the world have embraced mass customization in an attempt to avoid those pitfalls. Readily available information technology and flexible work processes permit them to customize goods or services for individual customers in high volumes at low cost. But many managers have discovered that mass customization itself can produce unnecessary cost and complexity. They are realizing that they did not examine thoroughly enough what kind of customization their customers would value before they plunged ahead. That is understandable. Until now, no framework has existed to help managers determine the type of customization they should pursue. James Gilmore and Joseph Pine provide managers with just such a framework. They have identified four distinct approaches to customization. When designing or redesigning a product, process, or business unit, managers should examine each approach for possible insights into how to serve their customers best. In some cases, a single approach will dominate the design. More often, however, managers will need a mix of some or all of the four approaches to serve their own particular set of customers.},

 abstract = {The simple comparison of two binomial populations is frequently of interest in epidemiology when the

domains are large. For small domains, however, there are no exact methods except Fisher{\~O}s exact test.

A basic problem, therefore, is to compare two populations by assessing the di¤erence between the

proportions of individuals who possess a characteristic in the {\TH}rst and second populations. When there is

prior information, we take the proportions to have independent conjugate beta distributions with known

parameters, thereby facilitating a Bayesian analysis. We consider Bayesian inference on functions of the

proportions, and the three most common scalar measures used in epidemiology and health services research,

namely relative risk, odds ratio and attributable risk. We develop the highest density regions (both exact and

approximate) for relative risk, odds ratio and attributable risk. In addition, we consider the Bayes factor for

testing whether the model with a common proportion holds rather than one with distinct proportions. Using

data from the population-based Worcester Heart Attack Study, we apply our methodology to study gender

di¤erences in the therapeutic management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by selected

demographic and clinical characteristics. The Bayes factor, the approximate and exact intervals generally

suggest that there are no substantial di¤erences in the pharmacologic management of males and females

hospitalized with AMI.},

The results indicated that crying babies stopped crying when either own mother or other mother odor was presented. Awake babies responded specifically to their own mother's odor by increasing mouthing. These results suggest that the practice of presenting the mother's odor to a distressed infant is of clinical usefulness since it was capable of attenuating crying. The results also characterized a role for maternal odor with respect to feeding since presentation of the infant's own mother odor increased mouthing. Thus, presentation of maternal odor may also be useful in enhancing nipple acceptance and feeding in newborns.},

@article{Lehmann.1998,
 abstract = {The article by Kahn (1998 [this issue]) nicely raises

many issues relating to product variety. Indeed, considerable

effort has been focused both on studying variety

seeking and on determining optimal strategies for offering

variety to customers. Much of this effort rests on the

assumptions that customers in fact both desire and benefit

from variety. The purpose of this is to question those basic

assumptions and hence to suggest some implications for

research.},

@article{Levin.1998,
 abstract = {Accentuate the positive or accentuate the negative? The literature has been mixed as to how the alternative framing of information in positive or negative terms affects judgments and decisions. We argue that this is because different studies have employed different operational definitions of framing and thus have tapped different underlying processes. We develop a typology to distinguish between three different kinds of valence framing effects. First we discuss the standard risky choice framing effect introduced by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) to illustrate how valence affects willingness to take a risk. Then we discuss attribute framing, which affects the evaluation of object or event characteristics, and goal framing, which affects the persuasiveness of a communication. We describe the distinctions, provide a number of examples of each type, and discuss likely theoretical mechanisms underlying each type of framing effect. Our typology helps explain and resolve apparent confusions in the literature, ties together studies with common underlying mechanisms, and serves as a guide to future research and theory development. We conclude that a broader perspective, focused on the cognitive and motivational consequences of valence-based encoding, opens the door to a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of framing effects.

@article{Luce.1998,
 abstract = {This article addresses how consumers resolve decisions involving conflict between attributes linked to highly valued goals, such as an automobile purchase decision requiring determination of how much safety one is willing to sacrifice in order to obtain other benefits. One salient goal for these decisions may be coping with or minimizing the negative emotion generated during decision making. The conceptual framework developed in this article predicts that choosing avoidant options (e.g., the option to maintain the status quo) can satisfy coping goals by minimizing explicit confrontation of negative potential decision consequences and difficult trade--offs. Two experiments demonstrate that reported emotion can be altered by manipulating decision attributes, that the opportunity to choose an avoidant option mitigates levels of reported emotion, and that increasingly emotion--laden decision environments are associated with more choice of avoidant options. Mediation analyses indicate that actual choice of an avoidant option results in less retrospective negative emotion (in experiment 1) and that increased initial negative emotion results in increased choice of avoidant options (in experiment 2). Mediation analyses for experiment 2 also indicate that increased response times mediate avoidant choice, in contrast to explanations of the status quo bias and similar choice phenomena that appeal to decision makers' desires to minimize cognitive effort.},

On the basis of Chakravarti and Lynch's framework for understanding context effects and prior research on consumer knowledge, we delineate two distinct influences of knowledge on the choice process and demonstrate that the moderating influence of knowledge on the attraction effect varies with the information mode. When the choice set information is presented numerically, greater category knowledge attenuates the attraction effect, but when information is presented verbally, greater knowledge actually increases the size of the attraction effect. The implications of these findings for the role of knowledge in consumer context effects are discussed.},

judgment vs. choice and the impact of justification

on the attraction effect, which refers to the increase

in the choice probability of the altemative most

similar to a newly added inferior altemative brand in

a choice set. One unexpected result, a strong

negative attraction effect that appeared in the

choice/low justification cell, coujd be caused by the

appeal of a {\textquotedbl}black sheep{\textquotedbl} altemative. A second

unexpected finding, the appearance of tlie attraction

effect in the judgment/high justification cell, may be

due to the force of the justification manipulation

which alters the judgment task to one of choice.},

 abstract = {Numerous rules-of-thumb have been suggested for determining the minimum number of subjects required to conduct multiple regression analyses. These rules-of-thumb are evaluated by comparing their results against those based on power analyses for tests of hypotheses of multiple and partial correlations. The results did not support the use of rules-of-thumb that simply specify some constant (e.g., 100 subjects) as the minimum number of subjects or a minimum ratio of number of subjects (N) to number of predictors (m). Some support was obtained for a rule-of-thumb that N $\geq$ 50 + 8 m for the multiple correlation and N $\geq$104 + m for the partial correlation. However, the rule-of-thumb for the multiple correlation yields values too large for N when m $\geq$ 7, and both rules-of-thumb assume all studies have a medium-size relationship between criterion and predictors. Accordingly, a slightly more complex rule-of thumb is introduced that estimates minimum sample size as function of effect size as well as the number of predictors. It is argued that researchers should use methods to determine sample size that incorporate effect size.},

With demographic characteristics and health status at baseline controlled for, respondents who owned pets reported fewer doctor contacts over the 1-year period than respondents who did not own pets. Furthermore, pets seemed to help their owners in times of stress. The accumulation of prebaseline stressful life events was associated with increased doctor contacts during the study year for respondents without pets. This relationship did not emerge for pet owners. Owners of dogs, in particular, were buffered from the impact of stressful life events on physician utilization. Additional analyses showed that dog owners in comparison to owners of other pets spent more time with their pets and felt that their pets were more important to them. Thus, dogs more than other pets provided their owners with companionship and an object of attachment.},

We contrast this principle of value maximization with the hypothesis that the option to delay choice or seek new alternatives is more likely to be selected when conflict is high than when it is low. This hypothesis is supported by several studies showing that the tendency to defer decision, search for new alternatives, or choose the default option can be increased when the offered set is enlarged or improved, contrary to the principle of value maximization.},

 abstract = {he long-term impact of studies of statistical power is investigated using J. Cohen's (1962) pioneering work as an example. We argue that the impact is nil; the power of studies in the same journal that Cohen reviewed (now the Journal of Abnormal Psychology) has not increased over the past 24 years. In 1960 the median power (i.e., the probability that a significant result will be obtained if there is a true effect) was .46 for a medium size effect, whereas in 1984 it was only .37. The decline of power is a result of alpha-adjusted procedures. Low power seems to go unnoticed: only 2 out of 64 experiments mentioned power, and it was never estimated. Nonsignificance was generally interpreted as confirmation of the null hypothesis (if this was the research hypothesis), although the median power was as low as .25 in these cases. We discuss reasons for the ongoing neglect of power. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The choice is not obvious, because the two broad classes of procedures serve a similar purpose, and share many important mathematical characteristics.

Here we summarize relevant information for the prospective factor/component analyst. First, we discuss the key algebraic similarities and differences. Next, we analyze a number of theoretical and practical issues. The more practical aspects include: the degree of numeric similarity between solutions from the two methods, some common rules for the number of factors to be retained, effects resulting from overextraction, problems with improper solutions, and comparisons in computational efficiency. Finally, we review some broader theoretical issues: the factor indeterminacy issue, the differences between exploratory and confirmatory procedures, and the issue of latent versus manifest variables.},

 abstract = {[Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.]},

This equation is appropriate for predicting criterion mean eigenvalues and was derived from random data sets containing between 5 and 50 variables and between 50 and 500 subjects. This relatively simple equation is more accurate for predicting mean eigenvalues from random data matrices with unities in the diagonals than a previously published equation. Moreover, given that the parallel analysis decision rule may be too dependent on chance, our equation is also used to predict the 95th percentile point in distributions of eigenvalues generated from random data matrices. Multiple correlations for all analyses were at least .95. Regression weights for predicting the first 33 mean and 95th percentile eigenvalues are given in easy-to-use tables.},

Yet we have endeavored to write clearly enough and with enough introductory detail that the book should be accessible to a wide audience. It is therefore possible that the book can be useful for undergraduates, when their background is relatively sophisticated and their motivation is especially strong.  {\textquotedbl}The Psychology of Attitudes{\textquotedbl} is centered on research in the field of social psychology, where the attitude construct has been preeminent since the very beginnings of systematic research. Yet research on attitudes is a shared endeavor in the social sciences, with especially important contributions from the fields of sociology, communications, political science, and marketing. Although our book considers some of the work carried out in these neighboring fields, our own disciplinary background in psychology leads us to focus on distinctively psychological issues. Nonetheless, the book should be useful to graduate students and researchers in related fields, because a very large portion of the existing literature on attitudes is in fact psychological in its focus. Much of this work can be applied in the natural settings and should therefore also be interesting to practitioners, especially to those who design programs to change attitudes and behavior.  This book does not promote a single theoretical perspective. Our own work has mainly concerned attitude change, where we of course have theoretical preferences. Nevertheless, we have tried to be even-handed in evaluating the theories that other attitude researchers have proposed. We have emphasized the contributions of the approaches more than their weaknesses and shortcomings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

protocols collected during a decision task. The four loadproducing

variables all had a significant effect on decision

time, with the task-effect variables having the greatest influence.

Of the two load-producing variables that showed a

significant relationship with decision accuracy, alternative

similarity had the most impact.},

@article{Kirschbaum.1993,
 abstract = {This paper describes a protocol for induction of moderate psychological stress in a laboratory setting and evaluates its effects on physiological responses. The `Trier Social Stress Test' (TSST) mainly consists of an anticipation period (10 min) and a test period (10 min) in which the subjects have to deliver a free speech and perform mental arithmetic in front of an audience. In six independent studies this protocol has been found to induce considerable changes in the concentration of ACTH, cortisol (serum and saliva), GH, prolactin as well as significant increases in heart rate. As for salivary cortisol levels, the TSST reliably led to 2- to 4-fold elevations above baseline with similar peak cortisol concentrations. Studies are summarized in which TSST-induced cortisol increases elucidated some of the multiple variables contributing to the interindividual variation in adrenocortical stress responses. The results suggest that gender, genetics and nicotine consumption can influence the individual's stress responsiveness to psychological stress while personality traits showed no correlation with cortisol responses to TSST stimulation. From these data we conclude that the TSST can serve as a tool for psychobiological research.},

They also rated the importance of the room$\prime$s characteristics. Then they were told that the rooms on the short list all had been rented, and that no new rooms had become available so they would have to create a new short list from among the previously rejected rooms. Then they rescreened the rejected options and rerated the importance of the characteristics of the rooms. It was found that nearly 90{\%} of the subjects would prefer to begin again with new options rather than rescreen rejected options. It also was found that when forced to rescreen rejected options, subjects reduced their ratings of the importance of the options$\prime$ characteristics, apparently in an effort to compensate, at least in part, for having to select options that, only moments before, had been regarded as unacceptable. Efforts to discourage ratings reductions proved futile. Implications of the results for screening and choice are discussed.},

This article presents three studies offering evidence for the positive role of casual interpersonal touch on consumer behavior.

Further, customers touched by a requester tend to comply more than customers in no-touch conditions. Implications for consumer behavior theory and research are discussed.},

@article{Simonson.1992,
 abstract = {It is suggested that consumers' choices between alternatives can be systematically influenced by asking them to anticipate the regret and responsibility they would feel if they made the wrong decision. Specifically, on the basis of the notion that choices of conventional or default options are associated with lower regret and responsibility, it is proposed that consumers who anticipate how they would feel if they made the wrong decision would be more likely to purchase a currently available item on sale rather than wait for a better sale and more likely to prefer a higher-priced, well-known brand over a less expensive, lesser-known brand. These propositions were supported in three studies. The findings also suggest that an error caused by selection of a lesser-known, lower-priced brand is associated with greater responsibility but less regret than an error caused by a choice of a well-known, higher-priced brand},

These hypotheses can explain previous findings (e.g., asymmetric dominance and compromise effects) and predict some new effects. These effects were demonstrated in a series of 22 studies (with 100--220 university students) using consumer products as choice alternatives.},

@article{Simonson.1993,
 abstract = {A set of alternatives under consideration is often divided into subsets (or local sets) by some external (e.g., product display format at the store) or internal (e.g., a decision rule) factor. We propose that the manner in which a global set of alternatives varying in price and quality is divided into local sets can have a systematic effect on consumer choice between a lower price alternative and a higher quality alternative. Three such effects are investigated: (1) Consumers who first choose from pairs of products ({A, B}, {B, C}, {A, C}) and then choose from the set of all three products ({A, B, C}) are more likely to prefer the cheapest alternative than consumers who only choose from the complete set; (2) The choice share of a low-price, low-quality brand is greater when alternatives varying in price, quality, and features are displayed by brand (i.e., each display presents different models of one brand) as compared to a display by feature level (i.e., each display presents comparable models of different brands); and (3) Consumers considering a pair of two-option local sets, each consisting of different brands and feature levels (e.g., a feature enhanced model of a low quality brand vs. a basic model of a high quality brand), are more likely to select a feature enhanced model from the global set (of four options) than those who consider the same alternatives in other local set configurations or consider only the global set. These predictions were supported in seven studies, which also provided insights into the boundaries of the effects (focusing on the paired-comparison effect). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.},

@article{Tversky.1993,
 abstract = {The standard theory of choice---based on value maximization---associates with each option a real value such that, given an offered set, the decision maker chooses the option with the highest value. Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the ``market share'' of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent preferences.},

@article{Widaman.1993,
 abstract = {The aim of the present article was to reconsider several conclusions by Velicer and Jackson (1990a) in their review of issues that arise when comparing common factor analysis and principal component analysis. Specifically, the three conclusions by Velicer and Jackson that are considered in the present article are: (a) that common factor and principal component solutions are similar, (b) that differences between common factor and principal component solutions appear only when too many dimensions are extracted, and (c) that common factor and principal component parameters are equally generalizable. In contrast, Snook and Gorsuch (1989) argued recently that principal component analysis and common factor analysis led to different, dissimilar estimates of pattern loadings, terming the principal component loadings biased and the common factor loadings unbiased. In the present article, after replicating the Snook and Gorsuch results, an extension demonstrated that the difference between common factor and principal component pattern loadings is inversely related to the number of indicators per factor, not to the total number of observed variables in the analysis, countering claims by both Snook and Gorsuch and Velicer and Jackson. Considering the more general case of oblique factors, one concomitant of overrepresentation of pattern loadings is an underrepresentation of intercorrelations among dimensions represented by principal component analysis, whereas comparable values obtained using factor analysis are accurate. Differences in parameters deriving from principal component analysis and common factor analysis were explored in relation to several additional aspects of population data, such as variation in the level of communality of variables on a given factor and the moving of a variable from one battery of measures to another. The results suggest that principal component analysis should not be used if a researcher wishes to obtain parameters reflecting latent constructs or factors.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Primary care is a key element of health care systems and addresses the main health problems of the population. Due to the demographic change, primary care even gains in importance. The knowledge of the patients' preferences can help policy makers as well as physicians to set priorities in their effort to make health care delivery more responsive to patients' needs. Our objective was to describe which aspects of primary care were included in preference studies and which of them were the most preferred aspects.

METHODS

In order to elicit the preferences for primary care, a systematic literature search was conducted. Two researchers searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO) and conducted a narrative synthesis. Inclusion criteria were: focus on primary health care delivery, discrete choice experiment as elicitation method, and studies published between 2006 and 2015 in English language.

RESULTS

We identified 18 studies that elicited either the patients' or the population's preferences for primary care based on a discrete choice experiment. Altogether the studies used 16 structure attributes, ten process attributes and four outcome attributes. The most commonly applied structure attribute was {\textquotedbl}Waiting time till appointment{\textquotedbl}, the most frequently used process attribute was {\textquotedbl}Shared decision making / professional's attention paid to your views{\textquotedbl}. {\textquotedbl}Receiving the 'best' treatment{\textquotedbl} was the most commonly applied outcome attribute. Process attributes were most often the ones of highest importance for patients or the population. The attributes and attribute levels used in the discrete choice experiments were identified by literature research, qualitative research, expert interviews, or the analysis of policy documents.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of the DCE studies show different preferences for primary health care. The diversity of the results may have several reasons, such as the method of analysis, the selection procedure of the attributes and their levels or the specific research question of the study. As the results of discrete choice experiments depend on many different factors, it is important for a better comprehensibility of the studies to transparently report the steps undertaken in a study as well as the interim results regarding the identification of attributes and levels.},

@article{Kostyra.2017,
 abstract = {The number of visually impaired and blind people is rising worldwide due to ageing of the global population, but research regarding the impact of visual impairment on the ability of a person to choose food and to prepare meals is scarce. The aim of this study was threefold: to investigate factors determining the choices of food products in people with impaired vision; to identify obstacles visually impaired people face while purchasing food, preparing meals and eating out; and to determine what would help them in the areas of food shopping and meal preparation. The data was collected from 250 blind and visually impaired subjects, recruited with the support of the National Association of the Blind. The study revealed that majority of the visually impaired make food purchases at a supermarket or local grocery and they tend to favour shopping for food via the Internet. Direct sale channels like farmers markets were rarely used by the visually impaired. The most frequently mentioned factors that facilitated their food shopping decisions were the assistance of salespersons, product labelling in Braille, scanners that enable the reading of labels and a permanent place for products on the shop shelves. Meal preparation, particularly peeling, slicing and frying, posed many challenges to the visually impaired. More than half of the respondents ate meals outside the home, mainly with family or friends. The helpfulness of the staff and a menu in Braille were crucial for them to have a positive dining out experience. The results of the study provide valuable insights into the food choices and eating experiences of visually impaired people, and also suggest some practical implications to improve their independence and quality of life.},

 abstract = {Billions of dollars are spent annually with the aim of enticing consumers to purchase food. Yet despite the prevalence of such advertising, little is known about how the actual sensation of this advertising media affects consumer behavior, including consequential choices regarding food. This paper explores the effect of acoustic pitch in food advertising, demonstrating in two studies, including a field study in a live retail environment, how the perception of pitch in advertising can impact food desirability and decisions regarding serving size. In study 1, a field study, pitch affects actual serving sizes and purchase behavior in a live, self-serve retail setting, with low pitch leading to larger serving sizes. Study 2 demonstrates how low pitch increases desire for a food product among hungry consumers, and that this effect is mediated by perceptions of size and how filling consumers believe the product will be. We discuss these results in the context of cross-modal correspondence and mental imagery.},

In addition, we investigated the potential moderating role of impulsivity in the effect of approach bias re-training on food consumption. Participants were 200 undergraduate women (17-26 years) who were randomly allocated to one of five conditions of an approach-avoidance task varying in the training of an approach bias for healthy food, unhealthy food, and non-food cues in a single session of 10~min. Outcome variables were approach bias for healthy and unhealthy food and the proportion of healthy relative to unhealthy snack food consumed. As predicted, approach bias for healthy food significantly increased in the 'avoid unhealthy food/approach healthy food' condition. Importantly, the effect of training on snack consumption was moderated by trait impulsivity. Participants high in impulsivity consumed a greater proportion of healthy snack food following the 'avoid unhealthy food/approach healthy food' training. This finding supports the suggestion that automatic processing of appetitive cues has a greater influence on consumption behaviour in individuals with poor self-regulatory control.},

The research reported here examines whether the haptic characteristics of a non-diagnostic product packaging cue, namely its weight, affects the response of consumers. This article reviews existing research on haptic transference and proposes a conceptual framework to explore how the weight of product packaging affects the flavor of the food or beverages, and, in turn, consumers' desire for consumption and willingness to pay. Two studies demonstrate that an increase in packaging weight affects both desire and willingness to pay for the product. These effects are serially mediated by perceived flavor intensity and overall flavor evaluation. Based on these insights, implications for the design of food and beverages packaging are discussed.},

@article{McCarthy.2017,
 abstract = {Fluid milk consumption has declined for decades while consumption of nondairy alternatives has increased. A better understanding of why consumers purchase fluid milk or nondairy alternatives is needed to assist increased sales of milk or maintain sales without further decline. The objective of this study was to determine the extrinsic attributes that drive purchase within each product category. The second objective was to determine the personal values behind the purchase of each beverage type to give further understanding why particular attributes are important. An online conjoint survey was launched with 702 dairy consumers, 172 nondairy consumers, and 125 consumers of both beverages. Individual means-end chain interviews were conducted with fluid milk consumers (n = 75), plant-based alternative consumers (n = 68), and consumers of both beverages (n = 78). Fat content was the most important attribute for dairy milk followed by package size and label claims. Consumers of fluid milk preferred 1 or 2{\%} fat content, gallon, or half-gallon packaging, conventionally pasteurized store-brand milk. Sugar level was the most important attribute for plant-based beverages, followed by plant source and package size. Almond milk was the most desirable plant source, and half-gallon packaging was the most preferred packaging. Means-end chain interviews results suggested that maintaining a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle was important to all consumer groups. Lactose free was an important attribute for plant-based alternative consumers and consumers of both dairy and nondairy. A distinguishing characteristic of those who only drank nondairy plant-based alternatives was that plant-based beverages contributed to a goal to consume less animal products, beliefs about animal mistreatment, and perceived lesser effect on the environment than fluid milk. Unique to fluid milk consumers was that fluid milk was perceived as a staple food item. These results suggest that the dairy industry should focus on the nutrition value of milk and educating consumers about misconceptions regarding dairy milk. Future beverage innovation should include the development of lactose-free milk that is also appealing to consumers in flavor.},

This study proposes two new features to avoid these limits: (a) strictly separating all forced and all free choice questions and (b) an adaptive mechanism to select fewer, but more informative, free choice questions. The use of these two features invokes two new discrete choice experiment methods: separated dual response (SDR), with just the first feature, and separated adaptive dual response (SADR), with both features. A conceptual comparison, simulation study, tests to address endogeneity concerns, and three empirical studies demonstrate the appeal of these two new features, relative to the benefits of existing discrete choice experiments, especially when estimating willingness to pay.},

@article{Schouteten.2017,
 abstract = {Although sensory and emotional evaluation of food products mostly occurs in a controlled laboratory environment, it is often criticized as it may not reflect a realistic situation for consumers. Moreover, products are mainly blind evaluated by participants, whereas external factors such as brand are often considered as key drivers of food choice. This study aims to examine the role of research setting (central location test versus home-use test) and brand information on the overall acceptance, and sensory and emotional profiling of 5 strawberry-flavored yogurts. Thereby, private label and premium brands are compared under 3 conditions: blind, expected, and informed (brand information). A total of 99 adult subjects participated in 3 sessions over 3 consecutive weeks. Results showed that overall liking for 2 yogurt samples was higher in the laboratory environment under the informed evaluation condition, whereas no effect of research setting was found under the blind and expected conditions. Although emotional profiles of the products differed depending on the research setting, this was less the case for the sensory profiles. Furthermore, brand information clearly affected the sensory perception of certain attributes but had less influence on overall liking and emotional profiling. These results indicate that both scientists and food companies should consider the effect of the chosen methodology on ecological validity when conducting sensory research with consumers because the laboratory context could lead to a more positive evaluation compared with a home-use test.},

@article{Sinding.2017,
 abstract = {Habituation is a filter that optimizes the processing of information by our brain in all sensory modalities. It results in an unconscious reduced responsiveness to continuous or repetitive stimulation. In olfaction, the main question is whether habituation works the same way for any odorant or whether we habituate differently to each odorant? In particular, whether chemical, physical or perceptual cues can limit or increase habituation. To test this, the odour intensity of 32 odorants differing in physicochemical characteristics was rated by 58 participants continuously during 120s. Each odorant was delivered at a constant concentration. Results showed odorants differed significantly in habituation, highlighting the multifactoriality of habituation. Additionally habituation was predicted from 15 physico-chemical and perceptual characteristics of the odorants. The analysis highlighted the importance of trigeminality which is highly correlated to intensity and pleasantness. The vapour pressure, the molecular weight, the Odor Activity Value (OAV) and the number of double bonds mostly contributed to the modulation of habituation. Moreover, length of the carbon chain, number of conformers and hydrophobicity contributed to a lesser extent to the modulation of habituation. These results highlight new principles involved in the fundamental process of habituation, notably trigeminality and the physicochemical characteristics associated.},

@article{Soares.2017,
 abstract = {Objective

To understand potential utilization of clinical services at a rural integrated health care system by generating optimal groups of telemedicine locations from electronic health record (EHR) data using geographic information systems (GISs).

Methods

This retrospective study extracted nonidentifiable grouped data of patients over a 2-year period from the EHR, including geomasked locations. Spatially optimal groupings were created using available telemedicine sites by calculating patients' average travel distance (ATD) to the closest clinic site.

Results

A total of 4027 visits by 2049 unique patients were analyzed. The best travel distances for site groupings of 3, 4, 5, or 6 site locations were ranked based on increasing ATD. Each one-site increase in the number of available telemedicine sites decreased minimum ATD by about 8{\%}. For a given group size, the best groupings were very similar in minimum travel distance. There were significant differences in predicted patient load imbalance between otherwise similar groupings. A majority of the best site groupings used the same small number of sites, and urban sites were heavily used.

Discussion

With EHR geospatial data at an individual patient level, we can model potential telemedicine sites for specialty access in a rural geographic area. Relatively few sites could serve most of the population. Direct access to patient GIS data from an EHR provides direct knowledge of the client base compared to methods that allocate aggregated data.

Conclusion

Geospatial data and methods can assist health care location planning, generating data about load, load balance, and spatial accessibility.},

@article{Stillman.2017,
 abstract = {Across four studies, we used mouse tracking to identify the dynamic, on-line cognitive processes that underlie successful self-control decisions. First, we showed that individuals display real-time conflict when choosing options consistent with their long-term goal over short-term temptations. Second, we found that individuals who are more successful at self-control-whether measured or manipulated-show significantly less real-time conflict in only self-control-relevant choices. Third, we demonstrated that successful individuals who choose a long-term goal over a short-term temptation display movements that are smooth rather than abrupt, which suggests dynamic rather than stage-based resolution of self-control conflicts. These findings have important implications for contemporary theories of self-control.},

@article{Tatler.2017,
 abstract = {Many of our actions require visual information, and for this it is important to direct the eyes to the right place at the right time. Two or three times every second, we must decide both when and where to direct our gaze. Understanding these decisions can reveal the moment-to-moment information priorities of the visual system and the strategies for information sampling employed by the brain to serve ongoing behavior. Most theoretical frameworks and models of gaze control assume that the spatial and temporal aspects of fixation point selection depend on different mechanisms. We present a single model that can simultaneously account for both when and where we look. Underpinning this model is the theoretical assertion that each decision to move the eyes is an evaluation of the relative benefit expected from moving the eyes to a new location compared with that expected by continuing to fixate the current target. The eyes move when the evidence that favors moving to a new location outweighs that favoring staying at the present location. Our model provides not only an account of when the eyes move, but also what will be fixated. That is, an analysis of saccade timing alone enables us to predict where people look in a scene. Indeed our model accounts for fixation selection as well as (and often better than) current computational models of fixation selection in scene viewing. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{Millan.2017,
 abstract = {Following a Pavlovian pairing procedure, alcohol-paired cues come to elicit behavioral responses that lead to alcohol consumption. Here we used an optogenetic approach to activate basolateral amygdala (BLA) axonal terminals targeting the shell of nucleus accumbens (AcbSh) and investigated a possible influence over cue-conditioned alcohol seeking and alcohol drinking, based on the demonstrated roles of these areas in behavioral responding to Pavlovian cues and in feeding behavior. Rats were trained to anticipate alcohol or sucrose following the onset of a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS). Channelrhodopsin-mediated activation of the BLA-to-AcbSh pathway concurrent with each CS disrupted cued alcohol seeking. Activation of the same pathway caused rapid cessation of alcohol drinking from a sipper tube. Neither effect was accompanied by an overall change in locomotion. Finally, the suppressive effect of photoactivation on cued-triggered seeking was also evidenced in animals trained with sucrose. Together these findings suggest that photoactivation of BLA terminals in the AcbSh can override the conditioned motivational properties of reward-predictive cues as well as unconditioned consummatory responses necessary for alcohol drinking. The findings provide evidence for a limbic-striatal influence over motivated behavior for orally consumed rewards, including alcohol.},

@article{Mohr.2017,
 abstract = {Individuals make decisions under risk throughout daily life. Standard models of economic decision making typically assume that people evaluate choice options independently. There is, however, substantial evidence showing that this independence assumption is frequently violated in decision making without risk. The present study extends these findings to the domain of decision making under risk. To explain the independence violations, we adapted a sequential sampling model, namely Multialternative Decision Field Theory (MDFT), to decision making under risk and showed how this model can account for the observed preference shifts. MDFT not only better predicts choices compared with the standard Expected Utility Theory, but it also explains individual differences in the size of the observed context effect. Evidence in favor of the chosen option, as predicted by MDFT, was positively correlated with brain activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and negatively correlated with brain activity in the anterior insula (aINS). From a neuroscience perspective, the results of the present study show that specific brain regions, such as the mOFC and aINS, not only code the value or risk of a single choice option but also code the evidence in favor of the best option compared with other available choice options.},

 abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the effects of diffused lavender on the frequency of behavioral issues [BIs], defined as a composite of restlessness/wandering [RW], agitation [AGT], anger [ANG], and anxiety [ANX] in an adult day care center. Secondary objectives evaluate systematic differences on the frequency of BIs between age cohorts, gender, and individual behaviors. Design: Pre-post quasi-experimental study. Setting: Private nonprofit adult day care center for patients with dementia. Participants: Elderly patients older than 65 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of dementia, who require daytime monitoring. Intervention: Lavender aromatherapy twice a day for 20 min during a two-month period during active clinic days. Measurements: Behavioral issues were recorded using the behavior/intervention monthly flow record during the pre- and post-intervention periods. Results: There was no significant difference on frequency of BIs between pre-intervention and post-intervention periods (p = .06). There was a significant difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention total number of AGT occurrences (129 vs. 25; p value {\textless} .01). There was no significant difference between age cohorts for computed difference of RW, ANG, and ANX issues. There was a significant difference between age cohorts for computed difference of AGT (p value = .04) as the 70-85 age cohort showed less agitation compared to the 85-100 age cohort. Conclusion: The use of diffused lavender twice daily has shown to reduce the frequency of agitation in elderly patients with dementia, especially in the 70-85 age cohort. Though diffused lavender did not show statistical differences in the frequency of other behaviors (restlessness/wander, anger, anxiety), the study population may have been too small to find a difference.},

 abstract = {We analyze the problem of learning a single user's preferences in an active learning setting, sequentially and adaptively querying the user over a finite time horizon. Learning is conducted via choice-based queries, where the user selects her preferred option among a small subset of offered alternatives. These queries have been shown to be a robust and efficient way to learn an individual's preferences. We take a parametric approach and model the user's preferences through a linear classifier, using a Bayesian prior to encode our current knowledge of this classifier. The rate at which we learn depends on the alternatives offered at every time epoch. Under certain noise assumptions, we show that the Bayes-optimal policy for maximally reducing entropy of the posterior distribution of this linear classifier is a greedy policy, and that this policy achieves a linear lower bound when alternatives can be constructed from the continuum. Further, we analyze a different metric called misclassification error, proving that the performance of the optimal policy that minimizes misclassification error is bounded below by a linear function of differential entropy. Lastly, we numerically compare the greedy entropy reduction policy with a knowledge gradient policy under a number of scenarios, examining their performance under both differential entropy and misclassification error.},

 abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests the incentive value of an option is affected by other options available during choice and by options presented in the past. These contextual effects are hard to reconcile with classical theories and have inspired accounts where contextual influences play a crucial role. However, each account only addresses one or the other of the empirical findings and a unifying perspective has been elusive. Here, we offer a unifying theory of context effects on incentive value attribution and choice based on normative Bayesian principles. This formulation assumes that incentive value corresponds to a precision-weighted prediction error, where predictions are based upon expectations about reward. We show that this scheme explains a wide range of contextual effects, such as those elicited by other options available during choice (or within-choice context effects). These include both conditions in which choice requires an integration of multiple attributes and conditions where a multi-attribute integration is not necessary. Moreover, the same scheme explains context effects elicited by options presented in the past or between-choice context effects. Our formulation encompasses a wide range of contextual influences (comprising both within- and between-choice effects) by calling on Bayesian principles, without invoking ad-hoc assumptions. This helps clarify the contextual nature of incentive value and choice behaviour and may offer insights into psychopathologies characterized by dysfunctional decision-making, such as addiction and pathological gambling.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

To explore how adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis could contribute to shared decision-making in the treatment of individual patients with osteoarthritis (OA).

METHODS

In-depth case study of three individuals randomly selected from patients with OA participating in an ACBC analysis exercise. Eleven members of a research users' group participated in developing an ACBC task on medication preferences for OA. Individual medication priorities are illustrated by the detailed analysis of ACBC output from three randomly selected patients from the main sample.

RESULTS

The case study analysis illustrates individual preferences. Participant 1's priority was avoidance of the four high-risk side effects of medication, which accounted for 90{\%} of the importance of all attributes, while the remaining attributes (expected benefit; way of taking medication; frequency; availability) accounted only for 10{\%} of the total influence. Participant 3 was similar to participant 1 but would accept a high risk of one of the side effects if the medication were available by prescription. In contrast, participant 2's priority was the avoidance of Internet purchase of medication; this attribute (availability) accounted for 52{\%} of the importance of all attributes.

CONCLUSIONS

Individual patients have preferences that likely lead to different medication choices. ACBC has the potential as a tool for physicians to identify individual patient preferences as a practical basis for concordant prescribing for OA in clinical practice. Future research needs to establish whether accurate knowledge of individual patient preferences for treatment attributes and levels translates into concordant behavior in clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Impulsivity is a variable behavioral trait that depends on numerous factors. For example, increasing the absolute magnitude of available choice options promotes farsighted decisions. We argue that this magnitude effect arises in part from differential exertion of self-control as the perceived importance of the choice increases. First, we demonstrated that frontal executive-control areas were more engaged for more difficult decisions and that this effect was enhanced for high-magnitude rewards. Second, we showed that increased hunger, which is associated with lower self-control, reduced the magnitude effect. Third, we tested an intervention designed to increase self-control and showed that it reduced the magnitude effect. Taken together, our findings challenge existing theories about the magnitude effect and suggest that visceral and cognitive factors affecting choice may do so by influencing self-control.},

This book provides comprehensive coverage of the field of outlier analysis from a computer science point of view. It integrates methods from data mining, machine learning, and statistics within the computational framework and therefore appeals to multiple communities. The chapters of this book can be organized into three categories: Basic algorithms: Chapters 1 through 7 discuss the fundamental algorithms for outlier analysis, including probabilistic and statistical methods, linear methods, proximity-based methods, high-dimensional (subspace) methods, ensemble methods, and supervised methods. Domain-specific methods: Chapters 8 through 12 discuss outlier detection algorithms for various domains of data, such as text, categorical data, time-series data, discrete sequence data, spatial data, and network data. Applications: Chapter 13 is devoted to various applications of outlier analysis. Some guidance is also provided for the practitioner.{\textless} The second edition of this book is more detailed and is written to appeal to both researchers and practitioners. Significant new material has been added on topics such as kernel methods, one-class support-vector machines, matrix factorization, neural networks, outlier ensembles, time-series methods, and subspace methods. It is written as a textbook and can be used for classroom teaching},

We show that although volunteers rarely chose the decoy option, its availability sparks a significant increase in overall cooperativeness and improves the likelihood of success for cooperative individuals in this game. The presence of the decoy increased willingness of volunteers to cooperate in the first step of each game, leading to subsequent propagation of such willingness by (noisy) tit-for-tat. Our study thus points to decoys as a means to elicit voluntary prosocial action across a spectrum of collective endeavours.},

Hence, the present study evaluates the utility of a novel immersive approach in sensory consumer testing. An immersive multisensory room was designed to reproduce consumption conditions close to real life, with large wall screen projections, audio and olfactory stimuli and furniture consistent with the video scenario. Overall liking and perceived freshness of two vegetable products (salad tomato and wild rocket) at different storage time were evaluated by a group of volunteers, regular consumers of the products. Evaluations were performed both in a immersive environment setting - the scenario was the dining room of a holiday farm overlooking a patio and the countryside - and in a traditional sensory lab setting, as a control. The magnitude of liking was higher when evaluations were performed in the immersive environment setting than in the traditional lab setting. However, the discrimination efficacy for freshness and liking of stored and un-stored vegetables was reduced in the immersive environment with respect to the control lab. Additional research, aimed at exploring other products and other consumption or purchase immersive scenarios, will further clarify whether these findings are product-dependent or determined by the contingent immersive situation.},

 abstract = {Olfaction is often considered a vestigial sense in humans, demoted throughout evolution to make way for the dominant sense of vision. This perspective on olfaction is reflected in how we think and talk about smells in the West, with odor imagery and odor language reported to be difficult. In the present study we demonstrate odor cognition is superior in odor-color synaesthesia, where there are additional sensory connections to odor concepts. Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which input in 1 modality leads to involuntary perceptual associations. Semantic accounts of synaesthesia posit synaesthetic associations are mediated by activation of inducing concepts. Therefore, synaesthetic associations may strengthen conceptual representations. To test this idea, we ran 6 odor-color synaesthetes and 17 matched controls on a battery of tasks exploring odor and color cognition. We found synaesthetes outperformed controls on tests of both odor and color discrimination, demonstrating for the first time enhanced perception in both the inducer (odor) and concurrent (color) modality. So, not only do synaesthetes have additional perceptual experiences in comparison to controls, their primary perceptual experience is also different. Finally, synaesthetes were more consistent and accurate at naming odors. We propose synaesthetic associations to odors strengthen odor concepts, making them more differentiated (facilitating odor discrimination) and easier to link with lexical representations (facilitating odor naming). In summary, we show for the first time that both odor language and perception is enhanced in people with synaesthetic associations to odors. (PsycINFO Database Record},

 abstract = {Can recent failures to replicate psychological research be explained by typical magnitudes of statistical power, bias or heterogeneity? A large survey of 12,065 estimated effect sizes from 200 meta-analyses and nearly 8,000 papers is used to assess these key dimensions of replicability. First, our survey finds that psychological research is, on average, afflicted with low statistical power. The median of median power across these 200 areas of research is about 36{\%}, and only about 8{\%} of studies have adequate power (using Cohen's 80{\%} convention). Second, the median proportion of the observed variation among reported effect sizes attributed to heterogeneity is 74{\%} (I2). Heterogeneity of this magnitude makes it unlikely that the typical psychological study can be closely replicated when replication is defined as study-level null hypothesis significance testing. Third, the good news is that we find only a small amount of average residual reporting bias, allaying some of the often-expressed concerns about the reach of publication bias and questionable research practices. Nonetheless, the low power and high heterogeneity that our survey finds fully explain recent difficulties to replicate highly regarded psychological studies and reveal challenges for scientific progress in psychology.

Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.},

@article{Turner.2018,
 abstract = {In accounting for phenomena present in preferential choice experiments, modern models assume a wide array of different mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, leakage, loss aversion, and saliency. These mechanisms create interesting predictions for the dynamics of the deliberation process as well as the aggregate behavior of preferential choice in a variety of contexts. However, the models that embody these different mechanisms are rarely subjected to rigorous quantitative tests of suitability by way of model fitting and evaluation. Recently, complex, stochastic models have been cast aside in favor of simpler approximations, which may or may not capture the data as well. In this article, we use a recently developed method to fit the four extant models of context effects to data from two experiments: one involving consumer goods stimuli, and another involving perceptual stimuli. Our third study investigates the relative merits of the mechanisms currently assumed by the extant models of context effects by testing every possible configuration of mechanism within one overarching model. Across all tasks, our results emphasize the importance of several mechanisms such as lateral inhibition, loss aversion, and pairwise attribute differences, as these mechanisms contribute positively to model performance. Together, our results highlight the notion that mathematical tractability, while certainly a convenient feature of any model, should neither be the primary impetus for model development nor the promoting or demotion of specific model mechanisms. Instead, model fit, balanced with model complexity, should be the greatest burden to bear for any theoretical account of empirical phenomena. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{Upadia.2018,
 abstract = {Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS, OMIM 606232) is a heterozygous contiguous gene microdeletion syndrome occurring at the distal region of chromosome 22q13. This deletion encompasses the SHANK3 gene at 22q13.33, which is thought to be the critical gene for the neurodevelopmental features seen in this syndrome. PMS is typically characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, absent to severely delayed speech, neonatal hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. Two patients presenting with classic clinical features of PMS have been reported to have interstitial microdeletions in the 22q13.2 region that map proximal to the SHANK3 gene (0.54 and 0.72 Mb, respectively). Here, we describe a 13-month-old girl with a de novo 1.16 Mb interstitial deletion in the 22q13.2 region who presented with global developmental delay, subtle dysmorphic features, and immunodeficiency. This deletion overlaps with the two previously published cases and five cases from the DECIPHER database. All eight patients share features common to patients with PMS including developmental delay and language delay, which suggests that this represents a previously unrecognized microdeletion syndrome in the 22q13.2 region. Our patient's deletion encompasses the TCF20 and TNFRSF13C genes, which are thought to play causative roles in the patient's neurodevelopmental and immunological features, respectively.},

 abstract = {This research examines an element of choice architecture that has received little attention---whether options are presented simultaneously or sequentially. Participants were more likely to choose dominating options when the options were presented simultaneously rather than sequentially, both when the dominance relationship was transparent (Experiment 1) and when it was not (Experiments 2--3). Depth of cognitive processing mediated the effect of option presentation on optimal choice (Experiment 4). Memory load was unlikely to be the underlying mechanism, as individual differences in working memory span did not predict optimal choice in the sequential condition (which places a greater memory load; Experiment 5), and manipulations of memory load did not reduce the benefits of simultaneous presentation (Experiments 6a--6c). Instead, participants' working memory span predicted optimal choice in the simultaneous condition (which allows for more in-depth processing; Experiment 5), and a manipulation of processing load eliminated the benefits of simultaneous presentation (Experiment 7).},

 abstract = {We examine whether phonetic symbolism effects are conditional on the development of phonological awareness (an ability to recognize sounds in words). Further, we introduce sublexical priming as a means to enhance phonetic symbolism effects. Across four experiments, we demonstrate that product evaluations, consistent with phonetic symbolism theory, are more (less) likely when a child is older (younger). Specifically, older children who can recognize sounds in words perceive back vowel brand names (e.g., Vopoz) as slower, heavier, larger, smoother, creamier, chewier, and thicker than brand names with front vowel sounds (e.g., Vipiz). In addition, we show that phonetic symbolism effects manifest when younger children (low in phonological awareness) are primed to focus on parts of a word/s, which we term sublexical priming. We present embedded tasks and chunking of brand names as strategic communication techniques that can be implemented as sublexical primes to enhance phonetic symbolism effects in younger children.},

 abstract = {The opportunity an object presents for action is known as an affordance. A basic assumption in previous research was that images of objects, which do not afford physical action, elicit effects on attention and behavior comparable with those of real-world tangible objects. Using a flanker task, we compared interference effects between real graspable objects and matched 2-D or 3-D images of the items. Compared with both 2-D and 3-D images, real objects yielded slower response times overall and elicited greater flanker interference effects. When the real objects were positioned out of reach or behind a transparent barrier, the pattern of response times and interference effects was comparable with that for 2-D images. Graspable objects exert a more powerful influence on attention and manual responses than images because of the affordances they offer for manual interaction. These results raise questions about whether images are suitable proxies for real objects in psychological research.},

A novel piece of music was composed and recorded in four different styles of musical articulation to reflect the four basic tastes groups (sweet, sour, salty, bitter). In Experiment 1, participants performed above chance at pairing the music clips with corresponding taste words. Experiment 2 uses multidimensional scaling to interpret how participants categorize these musical stimuli, and to show that auditory categories can be organized in a similar manner as taste categories. Experiment 3 introduces four different flavors of custom-made chocolate ganache and shows that participants can match music clips with the corresponding taste stimuli with above-chance accuracy. Experiment 4 demonstrates the partial role of pleasantness in crossmodal mappings between sound and taste. The present findings confirm that individuals are able to make crossmodal associations between complex auditory and gustatory stimuli, and that valence may mediate multisensory integration in the general population.},

 abstract = {According to the common-sense model of self-regulation, individuals form lay representations of illnesses that guide coping procedures to manage illness threat. We meta-analyzed studies adopting the model to (a) examine the intercorrelations among illness representation dimensions, coping strategies, and illness outcomes; (b) test the sufficiency of a process model in which relations between illness representations and outcomes were mediated by coping strategies; and (c) test effects of moderators on model relations. Studies adopting the common-sense model in chronic illness (k = 254) were subjected to random-effects meta-analysis. The pattern of zero-order corrected correlations among illness representation dimensions (identity, consequences, timeline, perceived control, illness coherence, emotional representations), coping strategies (avoidance, cognitive reappraisal, emotion venting, problem-focused generic, problem-focused specific, seeking social support), and illness outcomes (disease state, distress, well-being, physical, role, and social functioning) was consistent with previous analyses. Meta-analytic path analyses supported a process model that included direct effects of illness representations on outcomes and indirect effects mediated by coping. Emotional representations and perceived control were consistently related to illness-related and functional outcomes via, respectively, lower and greater employment of coping strategies to deal with symptoms or manage treatment. Representations signaling threat (consequences, identity) had specific positive and negative indirect effects on outcomes through problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. There was little evidence of moderation of model effects by study design, illness type and context, and study quality. A revised process model is proposed to guide future research which includes effects of moderators, individual differences, and beliefs about coping and treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Psychological Methods has published a number of influential articles on causal and formative indicators as well as launching the first major backlash against them. This article examines 7 common criticisms of these indicators distilled from the literature: (a) A construct measured with {\textquotedbl}formative{\textquotedbl} indicators does not exist independently of its indicators; (b) Such indicators are causes rather than measures; (c) They imply multiple dimensions to a construct and this is a liability; (d) They are assumed to be error-free, which is unrealistic; (e) They are inherently subject to interpretational confounding; (f) They fail proportionality constraints; and (g) Their coefficients should be set in advance and not estimated. We summarize each of these criticisms and point out the flaws in the logic and evidence marshaled in their support. The most common problems are not distinguishing between what we call causal-formative and composite-formative indicators, tautological fallacies, and highlighting issues that are common to all indicators, but presenting them as special problems of causal-formative indicators. We conclude that measurement theory needs (a) to incorporate these types of indicators, and (b) to better understand their similarities to and differences from traditional indicators.

 abstract = {Introducing customers to new ideas lies at the heart of marketing, yet surprisingly little is known about customers' state of inspiration within this domain. This article reviews prior conceptualizations of general inspiration in psychology and introduces customer inspiration as a customer's temporary motivational state that facilitates the transition from the reception of a marketing-induced idea to the intrinsic pursuit of a consumption-related goal. The authors develop and validate a two-state, 10-item customer inspiration scale that consists of inspired-by and inspired-to states. The scale development process begins with item generation, followed by five studies: (1) scale purification and initial validation, (2) exploration of the nomological network, (3) tests for the experimental and predictive validity, (4) replication within a field experiment, and (5) assessments of generalizability and boundary conditions. Empirical results reveal sound psychometric properties of the scale, demonstrate its unique position in relation to established marketing constructs, and support experimental and predictive validity. Applying the scale in marketing practice offers a new way for firms to increase demand, motivate customers' exploration behavior, and build customer loyalty.},

@article{Brown.2017,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Media exposure affects health, including obesity risk. Children's movies often contain food placements-frequently unhealthy foods. However, it is not known if these cues influence children's food choices or consumption after viewing. We explored whether children's snack choices or consumption differs based on: 1) recent exposure to movies with high versus low product placement of unhealthy foods; and 2) children's weight status.

METHODS

Children ages 9-11 were assigned to watch a high ({\textquotedbl}Alvin and the Chipmunks,{\textquotedbl} n~=~54) or low ({\textquotedbl}Stuart Little,{\textquotedbl} n~=~60) product-placement movie. After viewing, participants selected a snack choice from each of five categories, several of which were specifically featured in {\textquotedbl}Alvin.{\textquotedbl} Uneaten snacks from each participant were weighed upon completion. Snack choice and amount consumed by movie were compared by t-tests, and differences in snack choices by movie were tested with logistic regression.

RESULTS

Participants consumed an average of 800.8~kcal; mean kcal eaten did not vary by movie watched. Participants who watched the high product-placement movie had 3.1 times the odds (95{\%} CI 1.3-7.2) of choosing cheese balls (most featured snack) compared to participants who watched the low product-placement movie. Children who were overweight or obese consumed a mean of 857~kcal (95{\%} CI: 789-925) compared to 783~kcal (95{\%} CI: 742-823, p~=~0.09) for children who were underweight or healthy weight. Children's weight status did not significantly affect their choice of snack.

CONCLUSIONS

Branding and obesogenic messaging in children's movies influenced some choices that children made about snack foods immediately following viewing, especially food with greatest exposure time in the film, but did not affect total calories consumed. Future studies should examine how the accumulation of these messages affects children's long-term food choices.},

 abstract = {Meta-analytic evidence showed that the chemical senses affect moral decisions. However, how odours impact on morality is currently unclear. Through a set of three studies, we assess whether and how odour intensity biases moral choices (Study 1a), its psychophysiological responses (Study 1b), as well as the behavioural and psychophysiological effects of odour valence on moral choices (Study 2). Study 1a suggests that the presence of an odour plays a role in shaping moral choice. Study 1b reveals that of two iso-pleasant versions of the same neutral odour, only the one presented sub-threshold (vs. supra-threshold) favours deontological moral choices, those based on the principle of not harming others even when such harm provides benefits. As expected, this odour intensity effect is tracked by skin conductance responses, whereas no difference in cardiac activity - proxy for the valence dimension - is revealed. Study 2 suggests that the same neutral odour presented sub-threshold increases deontological choices even when compared to iso-intense ambiguous odour, perceived as pleasant or unpleasant by half of the participants, respectively. Skin conductance responses, as expected, track odour pleasantness, but cardiac activity fails to do so. Results are discussed in the context of mechanisms alternative to disgust induction underlying moral choices.},

 abstract = {The asymmetric dominance effect (ADE) occurs when the introduction of a partially dominated decoy option increases the choice share of its dominating alternative. The ADE is a violation of regularity and the constant-ratio rule, which are two derivations of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom, a core tenant of rational choice. The ADE is one of the most widely reported human choice phenomena, leading researchers to probe its origins by studying a variety of non-human species. We examined the ADE in brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella), a species that displays many other decision biases. In Experiment 1, we used a touchscreen method to elicit choice-based preferences for food rewards in asymmetrically dominated choice sets. In Experiments 2 and 3, we distinguished between different types of judgments and used a free selection task to elicit consumption-based preferences for juice rewards. However, we found no evidence for the ADE through violations of regularity or the constant-ratio rule, despite the similarity of our stimuli to other human and non-human experiments. While these results appear to conflict with existing literature on the ADE in non-human species, we point out methodological differences-notably, the distinction between value-based and perception-based stimuli-that have led to a collection of phenomena that are difficult to understand under a unitary theoretical framework. In particular, we highlight key differences between the human and non-human research and provide a series of steps that researchers could take to better understand the ADE.},

The current study investigated how mobile phone use affects where people look (visual search behaviour) and how they negotiate a floor based hazard placed along the walking path. Whilst wearing a mobile eye tracker and motion analysis sensors, participants walked up to and negotiated a surface height change whilst writing a text, reading a text, talking on the phone, or without a phone. Differences in gait and visual search behaviour were found when using a mobile phone compared to when not using a phone. Using a phone resulted in looking less frequently and for less time at the surface height change, which led to adaptations in gait by negotiating it in a manner consistent with adopting an increasingly cautious stepping strategy. When using a mobile phone, writing a text whilst walking resulted in the greatest adaptions in gait and visual search behaviour compared to reading a text and talking on a mobile phone. Findings indicate that mobile phone users were able to adapt their visual search behaviour and gait to incorporate mobile phone use in a safe manner when negotiating floor based obstacles.},

 abstract = {Research, directly assessing sex-dependent differences in global versus local processing is sparse, but predominantly suggesting that men show a stronger global processing bias than women. Utilizing the Kimchi-Palmer task however, sex differences in the number of global choices can only be found in children, but not in adults. In the current study 52 men and 46 women completed a computerized version of the Kimchi Palmer task, in order to investigate whether sex-differences in global-local processing in the Kimchi-Palmer task are reflected in choice reaction times rather than choices per se. While no sex differences were found in the number of global choices, we found that especially women are faster in making local choices than men, while men are faster in making global choices than women. We did not find support for the assumption that this sex difference was modulated by menstrual cycle phase of women, since the difference between reaction times to global and local choices was consistent across the menstrual cycle of women. Accordingly there was no relationship between progesterone and global-local processing in the Kimchi-Palmer task. However, like in studies utilizing the Navon task, testosterone was positively related to the number of global choices in both men and women. To our knowledge, this is the first study including reaction times as outcome measure in a Kimchi Palmer paradigm and also the first study demonstrating sex differences in the Kimchi Palmer task in adults.},

For these mechanisms to work, robust competition policy needs to be enacted and enforced. We compare the hospital markets in Germany, the Netherlands and England regarding their experience with competition and put a special focus on merger control and the stringency of its implementation. Elaborating on the differences in merger control practice we find that despite very similar goals the respective agencies apply very different approaches and take fundamentally different routes when balancing proclaimed benefits of mergers with potential risks of consolidated markets. While the German competition authority has a strong focus on maintaining the preconditions for competition, in the Netherlands we find over the past decade a much stronger focus on hypothesized countervailing buyer power, accepting in turn highly concentrated markets. In England we find the currently most comprehensive analysis of proposed mergers in combination with a clearly positive assessment of the effects of patient choice and competition on prices and quality. All agencies are still reluctant to implement merger simulation models or similarly advanced econometric methods in their appraisal. One very likely reason is a lack of country specific empirical evidence on these matters.},

 abstract = {Standard economic theories assume that people are self-interested and their wellbeing solely dependent on their own material gains or losses. Unless they have an impact on monetary payoffs, the perceptions of anonymous individuals are irrelevant to people's decision making. However, a large body of research in sociology and social psychology demonstrates that self-identity is developed through one's understanding of how one is perceived by others. Using (Cooley's, Human nature and the social order, 1964) concept of the ``looking-glass self'' as a framework, we evaluate experimentally whether or not people care about the imputed judgment of anonymous others arising from their imagination of their perceptions. We implemented variants of the Becker--DeGroot--Marschak mechanism to elicit the monetary value attached to the perceptions by participants. In one variant, only nonnegative bids were allowed, while in another, negative bids were allowed. We show that in an environment in which the perceptions of others are only conveyed to participants anonymously and privately, self-interested individuals exhibited strong negative perception avoidance even though the perceptions have no impact on their monetary payoff. The participants were willing to spend a significant amount in order to avoid confirming the supposedly negative perception. Thus, for them, ignorance was truly bliss. We also show that, in the absence of the audience effect, the fair-minded participants adopted a neutral attitude towards the perception of them as fair.},

1, when a compromise set was presented, subjects who had chosen an asymmetrically dominating option from an attraction set

a binary set. Lower susceptibility to the compromise heuristic suggests that asymmetric dominance might have facilitated

the learning of attribute preferences. In Experiment 2, subjects were asked to make six choices in the personal computer

category. Subjects who had chosen any number of asymmetrically dominating options from the attraction condition were less

susceptible to the compromise heuristic in a subsequent choice task than their counterparts who had chosen the same number

of equivalent options from the binary condition. It was unlikely that the effect was caused by better memory of asymmetrically dominating options subjects had previously chosen. Results from the two experiments corroborated the reasoning that

asymmetric dominance affects the learning of attribute weights and this effect persists in a subsequent choice task},

The goal of the book is practical, but the approach will be both academic and applied. It is aimed primarily at sensory scientists and the product developers they work alongside who require knowledge of measuring emotion to ensure high levels of consumer acceptability of their products. The book begins with a review of basic studies of emotion, including the theory, physiology, and psychology of emotions - these are the standard studies of which food and sensory scientists as well as product developers need to be aware. The next section highlights methods for studying emotions on a relatively basic level. The book then moves to practical applications, with chapters on emotion research in food and beverage, as well as in a range of product and clinical settings. Finally, there is a treatment of cross-cultural research on emotions. This is critical because much of the newer commercial research is aimed at markets around the world, requiring methods which work in many cultures. The book ends with an integrative summary of the material presented.},

Three eyetracking studies reveal decision processes in conjoint choices that take less time and are more accurate with practice. We observe two simplification processes that are associated with greater speed and reliability. Alternative focus gradually shifts attention towards options that represent promising choices, while attribute focus directs attention to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with practice. In terms of biases, we detect a small but consistent focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the items not chosen. We also show that incidental exposures arising from the alternative first examined or from a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices. Overall, conjoint choice is revealed to be a process that is largely formed by goal-driven values that respondents bring to the task, one that is relatively free of distorting effects from task layout or random exposures.},

 abstract = {The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) measures addiction-like eating of palatable foods based on the seven diagnostic criteria for substance dependence in the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Most recently, a new version of the YFAS has been developed based on the revised eleven diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder in DSM-5. This YFAS 2.0 was translated into German and used among other measures in a study with 455 university students (89{\%} female) and in a study with 138 obese patients presenting for bariatric surgery (78{\%} female). In the student sample, the one-factorial structure of the English version could be replicated and internal consistency was alpha = 0.90. The diagnostic threshold for 'food addiction' was met by 10{\%} of the sample. 'Food addiction' diagnoses were associated with higher body mass, binge eating frequency, trait food craving, and attentional impulsivity as well as with lower perceived self-regulatory success in dieting. In the obese sample, the diagnostic threshold for 'food addiction' was met by 47{\%} of participants. Again, 'food addiction' symptomatology was associated with higher binge eating frequency and attentional impulsivity. However, those with a 'food addiction' diagnosis did not differ from those without a diagnosis in body mass. To conclude, psychometric properties of the English YFAS 2.0 were replicated for the German YFAS 2.0. Prevalence rates and correlates of 'food addiction' as measured with the YFAS 2.0 were similar to those found with the previous version of the YFAS. Thus, the German YFAS 2.0 appears to be a reliable measure that can be used for the investigation of addiction-like eating behavior, analogous to the original version of the YFAS and the English YFAS 2.0.},

In an attempt to counteract this threat, some companies utilize cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns, in which they offer to offset some of their products' negative side effects. However, as such campaigns may emphasize the product's harmfulness, it is not clear if they are beneficial. One field and one laboratory experiment, both incentive-compatible involving real purchases, show that customers are more likely to buy a conventional over a green product when the former is bundled with a campaign that is offsetting an unrelated problem rather than a problem caused by the product---unless the donation offsets the specific damage caused by the customers' own consumption. These effects are mediated by guilt.},

 abstract = {Using a meta-analysis of 142 experimental observations, this work examines the influence of different research design and outcome measures on extremeness aversion (i.e., the propensity to avoid extreme options in choice situations). The results indicate that extremeness aversion is a robust phenomenon: middle options are significantly more often selected than other options. However, the strength of this behavioral effect exhibits substantial variation (up to three times the average magnitude) across methodological decisions: employing price-quality tradeoffs, nondurable categories, or binary-trinary choice-set comparisons tend to reduce the probability of extremeness aversion among consumers, whereas using a larger number of tradeoff dimensions, non-numeric attributes, high-quality extensions, or utilitarian products increase its likelihood. Because extremeness aversion has been assessed using three different measurement paradigms (absolute-share changes, relative-share shifts, and middle-option proportions), we discuss their characteristics and investigate their degree of agreement. We find that the three measures can lead to rather different effect magnitudes and even contradictory conclusions about the effect of moderators.},

 abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

To develop and validate the Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale, which is based on Bandura's social cognitive theory.

BACKGROUND

A simulation programme is a significant teaching strategy for nursing students. Nevertheless, there are few evidence-based instruments that validate the effectiveness of simulation learning in Taiwan.

DESIGN

This is a quantitative descriptive design.

METHODS

In Study 1, a nonprobability convenience sample of 151 student nurses completed the Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale. Exploratory factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the instrument. In Study 2, which involved 365 student nurses, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation~modelling were used to analyse the construct validity of the Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale.

RESULTS

In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis yielded three components: self-regulation, self-efficacy and self-motivation. The three factors explained 29·09, 27·74 and 19·32{\%} of the variance, respectively. The final 12-item instrument with the three factors explained 76·15{\%} of variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0·94. In Study 2, confirmatory factor analysis identified a second-order factor termed Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale. Goodness-of-fit indices showed an acceptable fit overall with the full model (\textgreek{q}(2) /df (51)~=~3·54, comparative fit index~=~0·96, Tucker-Lewis index~=~0·95 and standardised root-mean-square residual~=~0·035). In addition, teacher's competence was found to encourage learning, and self-reflection and insight were significantly and positively associated with Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale. Teacher's competence in encouraging learning also was significantly and positively associated with self-reflection and insight. Overall, theses variable explained 21·9{\%} of the variance in the student's learning effectiveness.

CONCLUSION

The Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale is a reliable and valid means to assess simulation learning effectiveness for nursing students.

RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE

The Simulation Learning Effectiveness Scale can be used to examine nursing students' learning effectiveness and serve as a basis to improve student's learning efficiency through simulation programmes. Future implementation research that focuses on the relationship between learning effectiveness and nursing competence in nursing students is recommended.},

 abstract = {Evidence accumulation models transform observed choices and associated response times into psychologically meaningful constructs such as the strength of evidence and the degree of caution. Standard versions of these models were developed for rapid ( approximately 1 s) choices about simple stimuli, and have recently been elaborated to some degree to address more complex stimuli and response methods. However, these elaborations can be difficult to use with designs and measurements typically encountered in complex applied settings. We test the applicability of 2 standard accumulation models-the diffusion (Ratcliff {\&} McKoon, 2008) and the linear ballistic accumulation (LBA) (Brown {\&} Heathcote, 2008)-to data from a task representative of many applied situations: the detection of heterogeneous multiattribute targets in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operator task. Despite responses taking more than 2 s and complications added by realistic features, such as a complex target classification rule, interruptions from a simultaneous UAV navigation task, and time pressured choices about several concurrently present potential targets, these models performed well descriptively. They also provided a coherent psychological explanation of the effects of decision uncertainty and workload manipulations. Our results support the wider application of standard evidence accumulation models to applied decision-making settings.},

@article{Mao.2016,
 abstract = {The maximizing tendency denotes individuals' predisposition to look for the best option rather than settling for something that passes an internal threshold of acceptability. This research examines how maximizing affects the compromise effect: the preference for an option with relatively intermediate attribute values. Results show that maximizers attempt to maximize gains on all attributes (rather than to rely on a single, most important attribute as satisficers do) and make more compensatory tradeoffs, which leads to more often choosing a compromise option (Studies 2 {\&} 3). Results held whether maximization was measured as an individual difference variable (Studies 1 {\&} 2) or activated as a decision mindset (Study 3). When asked to make decisions for a (fictional) prototypical maximizer, however, people intuited fewer compromise choices (Study 4). This article concludes by discussing relevant theories on cognitive capacity, regulatory focus, and choice context effects, and by offering tangible suggestions for follow-up research},

@article{Wlomert.2016,
 abstract = {In this paper, we compare the standard, single-response choice-based conjoint

(CBC) approach with three extended CBC procedures in terms of their

external predictive validity and their ability to realistically capture consumers'

willingness to pay: (1) an incentive-aligned CBC mechanism (IA-CBC), (2) a

dual-response CBC procedure (DR-CBC), and (3) an incentive-aligned dualresponse

CBC approach (IA-DR-CBC). Our empirical study features a unique

sample of 2,679 music consumers who participated in a conjoint choice experiment

prior to the market entry of a new music streaming service. To judge the

predictive accuracy, we contacted the same respondents again 5 months after

the launch and compared the predictions with the actual adoption decisions.

The results demonstrate that IA-CBC and DR-CBC both increase the predictive

accuracy. This result is promising because IA-CBC is not applicable to every

research context so that DR-CBC provides a viable alternative. While we do

not find an additional external validity improvement through the combination of

both extensions, the IA-DR-CBC approach yields the most realistic willingnessto-

pay estimates and should therefore be preferred when incentive alignment is

feasible.},

A special case of such context effects is the decoy effect, which implies that the inclusion of a dominated alternative can influence the preference for non-dominated alternatives. Adapting the well-known experimental setting from the area of consumer behavior to the performance evaluation context of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), an experiment was conducted. The results show that adding a dominated decision making unit (DMU) to the set of DMUs augments the attractiveness of certain dominating DMUs and that DEA efficiency scores discriminating between efficient and inefficient DMUs serve as an appropriate debiasing procedure. The mention of the existence of slacks for distinguishing between strong and weak efficient DMUs also contributed to reducing the decoy effect, but it was also associated to other unexpected effects.},

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

 abstract = {The authors compare two conjoint analysis approaches eliciting consumer preferences among different product profiles of iced coffees in Norway: Rating-based and Choice-based conjoint experiments. In the conjoint experiments, stimuli were presented in the form of mock-up pictures of iced coffees varying in coffee type, production origin, calorie content and price, following an orthogonal design. One group of participants (n = 101) performed a rating task of 12 iced coffees whereas another group (n = 102) performed a choice task on 20 iced coffees presented in eight triads. Then, all participants performed self-explicated rating and ranking evaluations of the iced coffee attributes. The rating data were analysed by a Mixed Model ANOVA while the choice data were analysed by a Mixed Logit Model. Both models include conjoint factors, demographic variables and their interactions. Results show that the two approaches share similar main results, where consumers prefer low calorie and low price iced coffee products. However, additional effects are detected within each of the two approaches. Further, self-explicated measures indicate that coffee type is the primary attribute for consumers' selection of iced coffee. The two conjoint approaches are compared and discussed in terms of experimental designs, data analysis methodologies, outcomes, user-friendliness of the results interpretation, estimation power and practical issues.},

@article{Bangcuyo.2015,
 abstract = {Traditionally, sensory consumer testing is completed in isolated sensory booths where the influence of non-product (e.g., environmental) attributes is controlled. However, these highly controlled environments strip away meaningful contextual (visual, auditory and olfactory) information important in forming consumer perceptions, liking and behaviors. Moreover, boredom and lack of panelist engagement associated with typical testing paradigms can result in uninformative or misleading consumer data. We utilized an immersive environment depicting a virtual coffeehouse, replete with visual, auditory and olfactory cues found regularly in this setting, and compared liking scores for five coffees to those obtained from the same individuals in a traditional testing environment in which contextual information was absent. We found significant differences in preference order and liking for coffees evaluated by the same people in the two settings and showed hedonic data collected in the virtual coffeehouse to be more discriminating and a more reliable predictor of future coffee liking unlike data collected in traditional sensory booths. Additionally, we found consumers to be more engaged in the testing when evaluating coffees in the virtual coffeehouse, an outcome that likely also contributed to improved data quality. These results suggest that during product evaluations, extrinsic contextual information is processed simultaneously with the intrinsic product attributes to influence hedonic assessments and shape reward outcomes. Further, these results suggest that methodological changes to current testing strategies have the potential to improve the reliability of consumer data providing food and consumer product companies significant savings on product development costs and failed launches.},

We test whether game form misconceptions are necessary to produce willingness-to-pay (WTP) vs. willingness-to-accept (WTA) gaps in a valuation experiment in which subjects are randomly assigned to the role of either buyer or seller. We employ a design that allows us to identify whether a subject understood the incentive properties of a price-list version of the BDM mechanism. We find a robust WTP-WTA gap, even among subjects whose elicited valuations for a good of induced and known monetary value and whose ability to identify the payoffs resulting from their choices indicate an understanding of the incentive properties of the BDM mechanism. We conclude that game form misconceptions are not a necessary condition for the emergence of WTP-WTA gaps.},

Sensory testing and measurement are the main functions of sensory analysis. In recent years, the sensory and consumer field has evolved to include both difference testing and similarity testing, and new sensory discrimination methods such as the tetrads have received more attention in the literature. This second edition of Sensory Discrimination Tests and Measurements is updated throughout and responds to these changes and includes: A wide range of sensory measurements: Measurements of sensory effect (d', R-index and Gini-index); Measurements of performance of trained sensory panel (Intrac},

@article{Werner.2016,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Limited consumer use of health care report cards may be due to the large amount of information presented in report cards, which can be difficult to understand. These limitations may be overcome with summary measures. Our objective was to evaluate consumer response to summary measures in the setting of nursing homes.

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING

2005-2010 nursing home Minimum Data Set and Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) datasets.

STUDY DESIGN

In December 2008, Medicare converted its nursing home report card to summary or star ratings. We test whether there was a change in consumer demand for nursing homes related to the nursing home's star rating after the information was released.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

The star rating system was associated with a significant change in consumer demand for low- and high-scoring facilities. After the star-based rating system was released, 1-star facilities typically lost 8 percent of their market share and 5-star facilities gained over 6 percent of their market share.

CONCLUSIONS

The nursing home star rating system significantly affected consumer demand for high- and low-rated nursing homes. These results support the use of summary measures in report cards.},

@article{Smith.2016,
 abstract = {Barriers to clinical trial recruitment can delay study completion, potentially resulting in increased costs and an unrepresentative sample. In the current study of 150 participants with chronic pain, we used a computerized adaptive choice-based conjoint survey that included 8 characteristics that may affect enrollment in pharmacologic pain treatment trials (ie, treatment allocation, frequency of pain ratings, treatment administration method, current medications, number of study visits, availability of evening and weekend visits, invasiveness of laboratory procedures, payment). These data were analyzed using Sawtooth Software ver. 8.4.8 (Sawtooth~Software, Inc, Orem, UT), which identifies the characteristics that dominate participants' decisions across multiple sets of potential trials. Three characteristics had the largest relative importance in participants' trial preferences: 1) invasiveness of required laboratory procedures (ie, 22{\%}), with no procedures or blood tests preferred over ice-water sensory testing or skin biopsy; 2) ability to continue current pain medications (21{\%}); and 3) payment for study participation (21{\%}), with higher payment preferred. The fourth most important characteristic was number of study visits (13{\%}), with participants preferring fewer in-person visits and more phone contacts. Understanding the preferences of potential participants is an important step toward enhancing enrollment in pain treatment trials.

PERSPECTIVE

This article presents the preferences of individuals with chronic pain conditions regarding modifiable pain treatment trial characteristics (eg, number of study visits, payment, treatment allocation). These findings may help to improve enrollment into analgesic clinical trials and in turn accelerate the development of new pain treatments.},

In general, all the consumers are assigned to one of the segments even though they do not fit to the pattern of any cluster. Within the clustering of variables around latent variables (CLV) framework, we propose two new approaches to handle this problem. The first approach (``K + 1'' strategy) consists in explicitly identifying an additional cluster which we refer to as ``noise cluster''. The second approach (``Sparse LV'' strategy) computes the groups' latent variables of the CLV method with a sparsity constraint. Both strategies were tested on the basis of two real hedonic case studies and compared to the k-means cluster analysis. They made it possible to improve the discrimination between the products within each cluster and yield homogeneous clusters of consumers for a better understanding of the main tendencies of liking.},

@article{MaierNoth.2016,
 abstract = {Children's vegetable consumption falls below current recommendations, highlighting the need to identify strategies that can successfully promote better acceptance of vegetables. Recently, experimental studies have reported promising interventions that increase acceptance of vegetables. The first, offering infants a high variety of vegetables at weaning, increased acceptance of new foods, including vegetables. The second, offering an initially disliked vegetable at 8 subsequent meals markedly increased acceptance for that vegetable. So far, these effects have been shown to persist for at least several weeks. We now present follow-up data at 15 months, 3 and 6 years obtained through questionnaire (15 mo, 3y) and experimental (6y) approaches. At 15 months, participants who had been breast-fed were reported as eating and liking more vegetables than those who had been formula-fed. The initially disliked vegetable that became accepted after repeated exposure was still liked and eaten by 79{\%} of the children. At 3 years, the initially disliked vegetable was still liked and eaten by 73{\%} of the children. At 6 years, observations in an experimental setting showed that children who had been breast-fed and children who had experienced high vegetable variety at the start of weaning ate more of new vegetables and liked them more. They were also more willing to taste vegetables than formula-fed children or the no or low variety groups. The initially disliked vegetable was still liked by 57{\%} of children. This follow-up study suggests that experience with chemosensory variety in the context of breastfeeding or at the onset of complementary feeding can influence chemosensory preferences for vegetables into childhood.},

Although telehealth offers an improved approach to providing healthcare services, its adoption by end users remains slow. With an older population as the main target, these traditionally conservative users pose a big challenge to the successful implementation of innovative telehealth services.

OBJECTIVES

The objective of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the factors affecting older users' acceptance of Home Telehealth Services (HTS).

METHODS

A survey instrument was administered to 400 participants aged 50 years and above from both rural and urban environments in Slovenia. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effect of seven hypothesized predicting factors. HTS were introduced as a bundle of functionalities, representing future services that currently do not exist. This enabled users' perceptions to be measured on the conceptual level, rather than attitudes to a specific technical solution.

RESULTS

Six relevant predictors were confirmed in older users' HTS acceptance behavior, with Performance Expectancy (r=0.30), Effort Expectancy (r=0.49), Facilitating Conditions (r=0.12), and Perceived Security (r=0.16) having a direct impact on behavioral intention to use HTS. In addition, Computer Anxiety is positioned as an antecedent of Effort Expectancy with a strong negative influence (r=-0.61), and Doctor's Opinion influence showed a strong impact on Performance Expectancy (r=0.31). The results also indicate Social Influence as an irrelevant predictor of acceptance behavior. The model of six predictors yielded 77{\%} of the total variance explained in the final measured Behavioral Intention to Use HTS by older adults.

CONCLUSION

The level at which HTS are perceived as easy to use and manage is the leading acceptance predictor in older users' HTS acceptance. Together with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Security, these three factors represent the key influence on older people's HTS acceptance behavior. When promoting HTS, interventions should focus to portray it as secure. Marketing interventions should focus also on promoting HTS among health professionals, using them as social agents to frame the services as useful and beneficial. The important role of computer anxiety may result in a need to use different equipment such as a tablet computer to access HTS. Finally, this paper introduces important methodological guidelines for measuring perceptions on a conceptual level of future services that currently do not exist.},

Little is known about the effects of such biases on the quality of data-driven market segmentation solutions. This study uses artificial data sets of known structure to study the effects of data problems on segment recovery. Some of the data problems under study are partially under the control of market research companies, some are outside their control. Results indicate that (1) insufficient sample sizes lead to suboptimal segmentation solutions; (2) biases in survey data have a strong negative effect on segment recovery; (3) increasing the sample size can compensate for some biases; (4) the effect of sample size increase on segment recovery demonstrates decreasing marginal returns; and---for highly detrimental biases---(5) improvement in segment recovery at high sample size levels occurs only if additional data is free of bias.},

 abstract = {CONTEXT

The strategy of publicly reporting quality indicators is being widely promoted through public policies as a way to make health care delivery more efficient.

OBJECTIVE

To assess general practitioners' (GPs) use of the comparative hospital quality indicators made available by public services and the media, as well as GPs' perceptions of their qualities and usefulness.

METHOD

A telephone survey of a random sample representing all self-employed GPs in private practice in France.

RESULTS

A large majority (84.1{\%}-88.5{\%}) of respondents (n = 503; response rate of 56{\%}) reported that they never used public comparative indicators, available in the mass media or on government and non-government Internet sites, to influence their patients' hospital choices. The vast majority of GPs rely mostly on traditional sources of information when choosing a hospital. At the same time, this study highlights favourable opinions shared by a large proportion of GPs regarding several aspects of hospital quality indicators, such as their good qualities and usefulness for other purposes. In sum, the results show that GPs make very limited use of hospital quality indicators based on a consumer choice paradigm but, at the same time, see them as useful in ways corresponding more to the usual professional paradigms, including as a means to improve quality of care.},

Results demonstrated that the effect of the product labeling on physiological alertness (systolic blood pressure), psychological alertness (self-reported alertness), functional alertness (cognitive interference), and product endorsement was moderated by social influence: participants experienced more subjective, physiological and functional alertness and stronger product endorsement when they consumed the product in the confirming social influence condition than when they consumed the product in the disconfirming social influence condition. These results suggest that social influence can alter subjective, physiological, and functional responses to a faux product, in this case transforming the effects of plain water.},

 abstract = {The history of humankind is an epic of cooperation, which is ubiquitous across societies and increasing in scale. Much human cooperation occurs where it is risky to cooperate for mutual benefit because successful cooperation depends on a sufficient level of cooperation by others. Here we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide that mediates complex mammalian social behaviors such as pair bonding, social recognition and aggression causally increases humans' willingness to engage in risky, mutually beneficial cooperation. In two double-blind experiments, male participants received either AVP or placebo intranasally and made decisions with financial consequences in the {\textquotedbl}Stag hunt{\textquotedbl} cooperation game. AVP increases humans' willingness to cooperate. That increase is not due to an increase in the general willingness to bear risks or to altruistically help others. Using functional brain imaging, we show that, when subjects make the risky Stag choice, AVP down-regulates the BOLD signal in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a risk-integration region, and increases the left dlPFC functional connectivity with the ventral pallidum, an AVP receptor-rich region previously associated with AVP-mediated social reward processing in mammals. These findings show a previously unidentified causal role for AVP in social approach behavior in humans, as established by animal research.},

 abstract = {Bovine udder health in Switzerland is of a relatively high level. However, antimicrobial usage (AMU) seems high in comparison to other European countries also. A new udder health and AMU improvement program could improve this situation but it is uncertain whether there is support from the field. This study aimed to quantify preferences of dairy farmers and veterinarians for the start and design characteristics of a new national udder health and AMU improvement program in Switzerland. A total of 478 dairy farmers and 98 veterinarians completed an online questionnaire. Questions on their demographics and their mindset toward AMU were complemented with an adaptive choice-based conjoint interview, a novel conjoint analysis technique to quantify preferences of respondents for characteristics of a product for which multiple trade-off decisions must be made (here a bovine udder health and AMU improvement program). The conjoint analysis was followed by a multivariate multiple regression analysis to identify groups of respondents with different program design preferences. Logistic regression models were used to associate covariates with respondents' preference to start a new udder health and AMU improvement program. Most farmers (55{\%}) and veterinarians (62{\%}) were in favor of starting a new voluntary udder health and AMU improvement program, but the program design preferences agreed moderately between the two stakeholder groups. Farmers preferred an udder health and AMU improvement program that did not contain a penalty system for high AMU, was voluntary for all dairy herds, and aimed to simultaneously improve udder health and reduce AMU. Veterinarians preferred a program that had the veterinary organization and the government taking the lead in program design decision making, did not contain a penalty system for high AMU, and aimed to simultaneously improve udder health and reduce AMU. Differences between groups of farmers and veterinarians concerning their start preference were identified. Also, the magnitude of various program design preferences changed for farmers with different opinions toward AMU. The information obtained from this study may support the decision-making process and the communication to the field afterward, when discussing national strategies to improve udder health and AMU in Switzerland.},

Emerging research indicates that beliefs influence the experience of eating. In three studies, we test whether beliefs about how animals are raised can influence the experience of eating meat. Samples of meat were paired with descriptions of animals raised on factory farms or raised on humane farms. Importantly, the meat samples in both conditions were identical. However, participants experienced the samples differently: meat paired with factory farm descriptions looked, smelled, and tasted less pleasant. Even basic properties of flavor were influenced: factory farmed samples tasted more salty and greasy. Finally, actual behavior was influenced: participants consumed less when samples were paired with factory farm descriptions. These findings demonstrate that the experience of eating is not determined solely by physical properties of stimuli-beliefs also shape experience.},

We match data on the hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries, including the identity of their physician, with data on the identity of the owner of their physician's practice. We find that a hospital's ownership of a physician dramatically increases the probability that the physician's patients will choose the owning hospital. We also find that patients are more likely to choose a high-cost, low-quality hospital when their physician is owned by that hospital.},

Many countries are thus introducing eHealth solutions to improve the availability of this medication information on a national scale (often called {\textquotedbl}e-medication{\textquotedbl}). The objective of this study is to analyse and compare the national e-medication solutions just being introduced in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. METHODS: Information on the situation in the three countries was collected within an expert group and complemented by an analysis of recent literature and legislation in each country. RESULTS: All three countries formulate comparable goals for the national eHealth solutions, focusing on improving medication safety. All three countries do not have a national e-prescription system. In all three countries, the implementation process was slower than expected and e-medication is not yet fully available. Differences of the three countries exist regarding chosen architectures, used standards, offered functionalities, and degree of voluntariness of participation. CONCLUSION: Nationwide e-medication systems and cross-border harmonization are acknowledged as important goals towards medication safety, but they develop slowly mainly due to privacy and security requirements, the need for law amendments and last but not least political interests.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Assess the relative importance of proximity and other hospital characteristics in the choice of hospital for breast cancer surgery by race/ethnicity.

DATA

SEER-Medicare data.

STUDY DESIGN

Observational study of women aged {\textgreater}65 years receiving surgery for stage I/II/III breast cancer diagnosed in 1992-2007 in Detroit (N~=~10,746 white/black), Atlanta (N~=~4,018 white/black), Los Angeles (N~=~9,433 white/black/Asian/Hispanic), and San Francisco (N~=~4,856 white/black/Asian). We calculated the distance from each patient's census tract of residence to each area hospital. We estimated discrete choice models for the probability of receiving surgery at each hospital based on distance and assessed whether deviations from these predictions entailed interactions of hospital characteristics with the patient's race/ethnicity. We identified high-quality hospitals by rates of adjuvant radiation therapy and by survey measures of patient experiences, and we assessed how observed surgery rates at high-quality hospitals deviated from those predicted based on distance alone.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Proximity was significantly associated with hospital choice in all areas. Minority more often than white breast cancer patients had surgery at hospitals with more minority patients, those treating more Medicaid patients, and in some areas, lower quality hospitals.

CONCLUSIONS

Residential location alone does not explain concentration of racial/ethnic-minority breast cancer surgery patients in certain hospitals that are sometimes of lower quality.},

METHODS: Two samples of men from French (N = 3318) and German (N = 2665) language areas of Switzerland were assessed with the GAS, the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale, and the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ-50-cc). They were also assessed for cannabis and alcohol use. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the scale was satisfactory (Cronbach alpha = 0.85). A one-factor solution was found in both samples. Small and positive associations were found between GAS scores and the MDI, as well as the Neuroticism-Anxiety and Aggression-Hostility subscales of the ZKPQ-50-cc. A small negative association was found with the ZKPQ-50-cc Sociability subscale.

@article{Kuss.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

In intervention trials, only randomization guarantees equal distributions of all known and unknown patient characteristics between an intervention group and a control group and enables causal statements on treatment effects. However, randomized controlled trials have been criticized for insufficient external validity; non-randomized trials are an alternative here, but come with the danger of intervention and control groups differing with respect to known and/or unknown patient characteristics. Non-randomized trials are generally analyzed with multiple regression models, but the so-called propensity score method is now being increasingly used.

METHODS

The authors present, explain, and illustrate the propensity score method, using a study on coronary artery bypass surgery as an illustrative example. This article is based on publications retrieved by a selective literature earch and on the authors' scientific experience.

RESULTS

The propensity score (PS) is defined as the probability that a patient will receive the treatment under investigation. In a first step, the PS is estimated from the available data, e.g. in a logistic regression model. In a second step, the actual treatment effect is estimated with the aid of the PS. Four methods are available for this task: PS matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), stratification by PS, and regression adjustment for the PS.

CONCLUSION

The propensity score method is a good alternative method for the analysis of non-randomized intervention trials, with epistemological advantages over conventional regression modelling. Nonetheless, the propensity score method can only adjust for known confounding factors that have actually been measured. Equal distributions of unknown confounding factors can be achieved only in randomized controlled trials.},

 abstract = {Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress and sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and therefore crucially impact consumer behavior. A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, we pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects' cognitive resources. In doing so, we study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects' tendency to avoid buying, and (2) their preference for product options that are positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, we find that a reduction of serotonin brain levels leads to choice deferral and eliminates the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision-making.},

A pencil-and-paper survey was conducted among N = 800 Dutch students. Most participants (87.8{\%}) reported consuming caffeinated beverages during the past 24 h. Their mean +/- SD past 24-h caffeine intake from beverages was 144.2 +/- 169.5 mg (2.2 +/- 3.0 mg/kg bw). Most prevalent sources of caffeine were coffee beverages (50.8{\%}) and tea (34.8{\%}), followed by energy drink (9.2{\%}), cola (4.7{\%}), and chocolate milk (0.5{\%}). Participants had poor knowledge on the relative caffeine content of caffeinated beverages. That is, they overestimated the caffeine content of energy drinks and cola, and underestimated the caffeine content of coffee beverages. If caffeine consumption is a concern, it is important to inform consumers about the caffeine content of all caffeine containing beverages, including coffee and tea. The current findings support previous research that the most effective way to reduce caffeine intake is to limit the consumption of coffee beverages and tea.},

The present study was conducted to explore the quality of life of married couples in relation to fertility status, years of marital life, resilience, and anxiety. A sample of 312 participants (156 fertile and infertile couples) was included in the study. The data obtained were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling with quality of life as multi-component endogenous latent variable; fertility status, years of marital life, and gender of the couple as binary coded single-item exogenous variables; and resilience and freedom from anxiety as multi-component mediating variables. In addition, the structural model also included the interaction effect of fertility status, gender, and years of marital life on the mediators and the endogenous variable. Results revealed that about 54~{\%} of variance in the quality of life could be explained using the model. Significant predictors of quality of life included fertility status, resilience, and freedom from anxiety. In addition, the effect of fertility status on quality of life was found to be moderated by both gender and years of marital life. The results also revealed that fertility status, gender, and years of marital life had additional indirect effects on quality of life through their effects on resilience and freedom from anxiety. Similarly, resilience had significant indirect effects on quality of life through its effects on freedom from anxiety.},

tradeoff analyses are vulnerable to whether product information is evaluated by

attribute- or alternative-based processing. By contrast, choices resulting from a minimal

cognitive processing are less sensitive to variations in the decision strategy employed.

We test our theory in the well-known domain of choice context effects. Across three

studies using multiple operationalizations of the decision process (i.e., information

display format, product presentation mode, and processing goal), we find converging

evidence that the more cognitively involving compromise choice increases when the

environment facilitates attribute- versus alternative-based processing. Conversely, the

choice of asymmetrically dominating option, which is characterized by relatively little

analytical processing, does not depend on the type of decision strategy highlighted by

the task.},

Previous studies of quality and choice of hospitals have used crude measures of quality such as mortality and readmission rates rather than measures of the health gain from specific treatments. We estimate multinomial logit models of hospital choice by patients undergoing hip replacement surgery in the English NHS to test whether hospital demand responds to quality as measured by detailed patient reports of health before and after hip replacement. We find that a one standard deviation increase in average health gain increases demand by up to 10{\%}. The more traditional measures of hospital quality are less important in determining hospital choice.},

For example, many retailers are more concerned about maximizing customer purchases within categories than influencing which brand is purchased in any particular category. Although this issue is important to researchers and practitioners, research on how contextual factors, such as decoys and prior decisions, affect whether consumers will ``choose to choose'' is scarce. We propose a reference-dependent model to fill this gap. This model unites several streams of research and leads to novel predictions that are tested and supported in four experiments. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.},

 abstract = {Contextual preference reversals occur when a preference for one option over another is reversed by the addition of further options. It has been argued that the occurrence of preference reversals in human behavior shows that people violate the axioms of rational choice and that people are not, therefore, expected value maximizers. In contrast, we demonstrate that if a person is only able to make noisy calculations of expected value and noisy observations of the ordinal relations among option features, then the expected value maximizing choice is influenced by the addition of new options and does give rise to apparent preference reversals. We explore the implications of expected value maximizing choice, conditioned on noisy observations, for a range of contextual preference reversal types-including attraction, compromise, similarity, and phantom effects. These preference reversal types have played a key role in the development of models of human choice. We conclude that experiments demonstrating contextual preference reversals are not evidence for irrationality. They are, however, a consequence of expected value maximization given noisy observations. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{SablotnyWackershauser.2020,
 abstract = {When we make decisions, we usually consider the context. This can sometimes lead to suboptimal choices or choice abnormalities. One such abnormality is the compromise effect, according to which deciders tend to favour options positioned as a compromise in an available set of extreme options. Theoretical accounts consider that these effects relate to available cognitive resources, which, in turn, have been found to depend on an individual's dopaminergic innervation. Referring to a correlative triad between cognition, dopamine and aging, the present study demonstrates that the compromise effect is replicable in a group of younger adults (n~=~27, 20-32 years of age) yet is attenuated in older adults (n~=~27, 62-80 years of age). Results from an [18F]-FDOPA-PET analysis in older adults indicate a positive association between older adults' inclination to engage in compromise effects and their striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. These results demonstrate altered context-dependent decision biases in older adults and suggest a neuromodulatory mechanism underlying this irregular choice.},

 abstract = {The majority of the world's population now lives an urban existence, spending as much as 95{\%} of their lives indoors. The olfactory atmosphere in the built environment has been shown to exert a profound, if often unrecognized, influence over our mood and well-being. While the traditionally malodorous stench to be found indoors (i.e., prior to the invention of modern sanitation) has largely been eliminated in recent centuries, many of the outbreaks of sick-building syndrome that have been reported over the last half century have been linked to the presence of a strange smell in the environment. At the same time, however, there is also growing evidence that consumer behavior can be manipulated by the presence of pleasant ambient odors, while various aromatherapy scents are said to improve our mood and well-being. This Anglophone review focuses primarily on indoor western urban developed spaces. Importantly, the olfactory ambience constitutes but one component of the multisensory atmosphere and ambient odors interact with the visual, auditory, and haptic aspects of the built environment. Surprisingly, the majority of published studies that have deliberately chosen to combine ambient scent with other sensory interventions, such as, for example, music, have failed to increase store sales, or to enhance people's mood and/or well-being, as might have been expected. Such negative findings therefore stress the importance of considering multisensory congruency while, at the same time, also highlighting the potential dangers that may be associated with sensory overload when thinking about the effect of ambient smell on our well-being.},

 abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin has been popularized for its role in social behaviour and nominated as a candidate treatment for several psychiatric illnesses due to promising preclinical results. However, these results so far have failed to reliably translate from animal models to human research. In response, there have been justified calls to improve intranasal oxytocin delivery methodology in terms of verifying that intranasal administration increases central levels of oxytocin. Nonetheless, improved methodology needs to be coupled with a robust theory of the role of oxytocin in behaviour and physiology to ask meaningful research questions. Moreover, stringent methodology based on robust theory may yield interesting results, but such findings will have limited utility if they are not reproducible. We outline how the precision of intranasal oxytocin research can be improved by the complementary consideration of methodology, theory and reproducibility.},

Operational Research - the ubiquitous 'science of better' - plays a vital role in supporting this decision-making process. To that end, using data from the USA, India, UK, Germany, and Singapore up to mid-April 2020, we provide predictive analytics tools for forecasting and planning during a pandemic. We forecast COVID-19 growth rates with statistical, epidemiological, machine- and deep-learning models, and a new hybrid forecasting method based on nearest neighbors and clustering. We further model and forecast the excess demand for products and services during the pandemic using auxiliary data (google trends) and simulating governmental decisions (lockdown). Our empirical results can immediately help policymakers and planners make better decisions during the ongoing and future pandemics.},

While elevated temperatures have been shown to impair short-run cognitive performance, much less is known about whether heat exposure affects the rate of skill formation. We combine standardized achievement data for 58 countries and 12,000 US school districts with detailed weather and academic calendar information to show that the rate of learning decreases with an increase in the number of hot school days. These results provide evidence that climatic differences may contribute to differences in educational achievement both across countries and within countries by socioeconomic status and that may have important implications for the magnitude and functional form of climate damages in coupled human-natural systems.},

However, the cognitive processes that give rise to irrational biases are still poorly understood. In this study, we use a pupillary index to arbitrate between two predominant existing hypotheses -- the hypothesis that biases result from fast effortless processing and the hypothesis that biases result from more extensive integration. While effortless processing is associated with smaller pupillary responses, more extensive integration has been shown to be associated with larger pupillary responses. Thus, we test the relationship between pupil responses and choice behavior on six different foundational decision-making tasks classically used to demonstrate irrational biases.Items: Protocol, Supplementary Information, Experiment Code, Pilot Code, Pilot DataItem Protocol: The in-principle accepted Stage 1 Registered Report Protocol.Item Supplementary Information:Supplementary Information file accompanying the Registered Report Stage 1 Protocol.Item Experiment Code:This item contains a compressed folder which includes all Matlab code that is required to run the experiment.

Prior investigations in this domain have relied primarily on choice data to compare different theories. Despite numerous such studies, results have largely been inconclusive. Our study uses state-of-the-art response-time modeling and data from 12 different experiments appearing in six different published studies to compare four previously proposed theories/models of these effects: multi-alternative decision field theory (MDFT), the leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), and the associative accumulation model (AAM). All four models are, by design, dynamic process models and thus a comprehensive evaluation of their theoretical properties requires quantitative evaluation with both choice and response-time data. Our results show that response-time data is critical at distinguishing among these models and that using choice data alone can lead to inconclusive results for some datasets. In conclusion, we encourage future research to include response-time data in the evaluation of these models.},

 abstract = {Researchers have suggested that acute exposure to violent video games is a cause of aggressive behavior. We tested this hypothesis by using violent and nonviolent games that were closely matched, collecting a large sample, and using a single outcome. We randomly assigned 275 male undergraduates to play a first-person-shooter game modified to be either violent or less violent and hard or easy. After completing the game-play session, participants were provoked by a confederate and given an opportunity to behave aggressively. Neither game violence nor game difficulty predicted aggressive behavior. Incidentally, we found that 2D:4D digit ratio, thought to index prenatal testosterone exposure, did not predict aggressive behavior. Results do not support acute violent-game exposure and low 2D:4D ratio as causes of aggressive behavior.},

 abstract = {Learning about hypothesis evaluation using the Bayes factor could enhance psychological research. In contrast to null-hypothesis significance testing it renders the evidence in favor of each of the hypotheses under consideration (it can be used to quantify support for the null-hypothesis) instead of a dichotomous reject/do-not-reject decision; it can straightforwardly be used for the evaluation of multiple hypotheses without having to bother about the proper manner to account for multiple testing; and it allows continuous reevaluation of hypotheses after additional data have been collected (Bayesian updating). This tutorial addresses researchers considering to evaluate their hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor. The focus is completely applied and each topic discussed is illustrated using Bayes factors for the evaluation of hypotheses in the context of an ANOVA model, obtained using the R package bain. Readers can execute all the analyses presented while reading this tutorial if they download bain and the R-codes used. It will be elaborated in a completely nontechnical manner: what the Bayes factor is, how it can be obtained, how Bayes factors should be interpreted, and what can be done with Bayes factors. After reading this tutorial and executing the associated code, researchers will be able to use their own data for the evaluation of hypotheses by means of the Bayes factor, not only in the context of ANOVA models, but also in the context of other statistical models.

@book{Chapman.2019,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}The 2nd edition of R for Marketing Research and Analytics continues to be the best place to learn R for marketing research. This book is a complete introduction to the power of R for marketing research practitioners. The text describes statistical models from a conceptual point of view with a minimal amount of mathematics, presuming only an introductory knowledge of statistics. Hands-on chapters accelerate the learning curve by asking readers to interact with R from the beginning. Core topics include the R language, basic statistics, linear modeling, and data visualization, which is presented throughout as an integral part of analysis. Later chapters cover more advanced topics yet are intended to be approachable for all analysts. These sections examine logistic regression, customer segmentation, hierarchical linear modeling, market basket analysis, structural equation modeling, and conjoint analysis in R. The text uniquely presents Bayesian models with a minimally complex approach, demonstrating and explaining Bayesian methods alongside traditional analyses for analysis of variance, linear models, and metric and choice-based conjoint analysis. With its emphasis on data visualization, model assessment, and development of statistical intuition, this book provides guidance for any analyst looking to develop or improve skills in R for marketing applications. The 2nd edition increases the book's utility for students and instructors with the inclusion of exercises and classroom slides. At the same time, it retains all of the features that make it a vital resource for practitioners: non-mathematical exposition, examples modeled on real world marketing problems, intuitive guidance on research methods, and immediately applicable code. .{\textquotedbl} -- Prov{\'e} de l'editor.},

In this work (1) we present the taxonomy of methods for model explanations, (2) we identify and compare 27 packages available in R to perform XAI analysis, (3) we present an example of an application of particular packages, (4) we acknowledge recent trends in XAI. The article is primarily devoted to the tools available in R, but since it is easy to integrate the Python code, we will also show examples for the most popular libraries from Python.},

@article{Radas.2021,
 abstract = {In this paper we propose a new method of eliciting market research information. Instead of asking respondents for their personal choices and preferences, we ask respondents to predict the choices of other respondents to the survey. Such predictions tap respondents' knowledge of peers, whether based on direct social contacts or on more general cultural information. The effectiveness of this approach has already been demonstrated in the context of political polling. Here we extend it to market research, specifically, to conjoint analysis. An advantage of the new approach is that it can elicit reliable responses in situations where people are not comfortable with disclosing their true preferences, but may be willing to give information about people around them. A theoretical argument demonstrates that predictions should yield utility estimates that are more accurate. These theoretical results are confirmed in four online experiments.},

@article{Shaddy.2021,
 abstract = {To explain trade-offs in choice, researchers have proposed myriad phenomena and decision rules, each paired with separate theories and idiosyncratic vocabularies. Yet most choice problems are ultimately resolved with one of just two types of solutions: mixed or extreme. For example, people adopt mixed solutions for resolving trade-offs when they allow exercising to license indulgence afterward (balancing between goals), read different literary genres (variety seeking), and order medium-sized coffees (the compromise effect). By contrast, when people adopt extreme solutions for resolving these exact same trade-offs, they exhibit highlighting, consistency seeking, and compromise avoidance, respectively. Our review of the choice literature first illustrates how many seemingly unrelated phenomena actually share the same underlying psychology. We then identify variables that promote one solution versus the other. These variables, in turn, systematically influence which of opposite choice effects arise (e.g., highlighting versus balancing). Finally, we demonstrate how several mistakes people purport to make can potentially instead be reinterpreted as mixed solutions for resolving trade-offs. We conclude with guidance for distinguishing mistakes from mixed solutions. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 72 is January 4, 2021.

@article{Arnold.2021,
 abstract = {In the United States, there is an unfortunate yet pervasive gender gap in wages: Women tend to make less than men for doing the same work. One prominent account for why this wage gap exists is that women and men negotiate differently. However, we currently do not know whether differences in negotiation are a product of extensive experience or are deeply rooted in development. Here, we brought data from children to bear on this important question. We gave 240 children between the ages of 4 and 9 years old a chance to negotiate for a bonus with a female or a male evaluator. Boys asked for the same bonus from a male and a female evaluator. Older girls, in contrast, asked for a smaller bonus from a male than a female evaluator. Our findings suggest that a gender gap in negotiation emerges surprisingly early in development, highlighting childhood as a key period for interventions.},

 abstract = {Maternal care, including by non-biological parents, is important for offspring survival1-8. Oxytocin1,2,9-15, which is~released by the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), is a critical maternal hormone. In mice, oxytocin enables neuroplasticity in the auditory cortex for maternal recognition of pup distress15. However, it is unclear how initial parental experience promotes hypothalamic signalling and cortical plasticity for reliable maternal care. Here we continuously monitored the~behaviour of female virgin mice co-housed with an experienced mother and litter. This documentary approach was synchronized with neural recordings from the virgin PVN, including oxytocin neurons. These cells were activated as virgins were enlisted in maternal care by experienced mothers, who shepherded virgins into the nest and demonstrated pup retrieval. Virgins visually observed maternal retrieval, which~activated PVN oxytocin neurons and promoted alloparenting. Thus rodents can acquire maternal behaviour by social transmission, providing a mechanism for adapting the~brains of adult caregivers to infant needs via endogenous oxytocin.},

 abstract = {Age-related changes in decision making have been attributed to deterioration of cognitive skills, such as learning and memory. On the basis of past research showing age-related decreases in the ability to inhibit irrelevant information, we hypothesize that these changes occur, in part, because of older adults' tendency to give more weight to low-level, subordinate, and goal-irrelevant information than younger adults do. Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings demonstrated that young adults are willing to pay more for a product with superior end attributes than a product with superior means attributes (Study 1, N = 200) and are more satisfied after an experience with superior end than means attributes (Study 2, N = 399). Young adults are also more satisfied with a goal-relevant than with a goal-irrelevant product (Study 3, N = 201; Study 4, N = 200, preregistered). Importantly, these effects were attenuated with age. Implications for research on construal level and aging, as well as implications for policymakers, are discussed.},

 abstract = {Numerous weight-loss interventions promoting healthy and weight-reducing eating behavior have been developed over the past years. To evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions for eating behavior change, short, validated and sensitive instruments are needed. In this study series, we developed and validated a new outcome measure to assess health-conscious and weight-controlling eating behavior for the evaluation of weight-loss interventions. The preliminary version of the German eating behavior scale (Skala zumErn{\"a}hrungsverhalten [SEV]) included 40 items. Three studies were conducted to (a) reduce the preliminary item pool, (b) investigate structural validity and internal consistency using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA, CFA), as well as McDonald's \textgreek{w}, and (c) test construct validity with physiological and behavioral parameters. Responsiveness to change was also assessed after a 12-week weight-loss intervention. EFA indicated a two-factor solution with health-conscious (hc-EB) and weight-controlling eating behavior (wc-EB) as subscales, CFA confirmed the two-factor solution with acceptable model fit. Internal consistencies of both subscales were also acceptable to good (hc-EB: \textgreek{w} = 0.88; wc-EB: \textgreek{w} = 0.78). Significantly small to moderate correlations to the Healthy Eating Index (r = 0.51) as well as blood glucose (r = 0.31), blood lipids (r = 0.23), and vascular age (r = 0.31) were found, supporting the construct validity of the SEV and its subscales. Both subscales detected intervention-related changes in eating behavior among subjects of a weight-loss intervention with Standardized Response Means of 0.52 and 0.67, indicating good responsiveness of the SEV. In sum, findings provide evidence that the SEV is a valid and responsive measure to assess health-conscious and weight-controlling eating behavior.},

@article{Hannum.2020b,
 abstract = {Sensory and consumer testing are primary strategies companies use to collect insights about consumer products. However, frequently, unreliable results from these tests can lead to failed product launches which can have enormous financial and/or brand equity consequences. One potential reason is sensory tasks are often deliberately devoid of additional stimulation which reasonably has the possibility to reduce a panelist's engagement with the task. Engagement may drive involvement and focus during testing and help generate reliable data. The overall objective of this study was to develop (Study 1), refine (Study 2), and validate (Studies 3--5) an engagement questionnaire (EQ), a tool to empirically assess varying engagement levels with a task. Prior literature and an exploratory qualitative assessment through an online platform (Study 1, N = 87) were used to operationalize the dimensionality of engagement and develop a preliminary questionnaire consisting of 54 items covering 7 themes (ability, attention, passivity, involvement, interest, motivation, and relevance). To assess the effectiveness of the initial item set, participants recalled being engaged with a task and answered the preliminary EQ (Study 2, N = 186). Results collected underwent an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in order to explore the dimensionality and refine the scale by strategically eliminating items. To validate the tool, the EQ was distributed following numerous consumer sensory tests that spanned a variety of food and beverage products, test lengths, number, and types of questions (Studies 3--5). EFA was conducted in Study 3 (N = 774), which resulted in a three-factor, 10-item model with good reliability (\textgreek{a} = 0.856). The new model was subsequently validated in two additional consumer sensory studies (Study 4A, N = 416 and Study 4B, N = 446). Both validation studies produced acceptable to good model fit indices with an RMSEA below 0.07, SRMR below 0.04, both CFI and TLI above 0.95 and good reliability (\textgreek{a} {\textgreater} 0.850). When tested in a different sensory testing facility, the EQ produced acceptable model fit indices (Study 5, N = 247) and tracked as expected with participants' perceived workload collected using the NASA Task Load Index; confirming the content and convergent and divergent validity of the instrument. Such an instrument allows for deeper understanding of panelist engagement and its impact on data quality, enabling the design of sensory tests capable of generating more reliable data both within the field of food science and beyond.},

In the current study, 155 participants spent 2 nights with their partner's scent and 2 nights with a control scent (in random order). Sleep was measured in two ways: sleep efficiency (via actigraphy) and perceived sleep quality (via self-report). Sleep efficiency was higher when participants were exposed to their partner's scent. This increase occurred regardless of participants' beliefs about the origin of the scent. Perceived sleep quality was higher when participants believed that they were smelling their partner's scent. Exposure to a partner's scent led sleep efficiency to increase by more than 2{\%} on average, an improvement similar in magnitude to the effect of melatonin on sleep. The current work speaks to the critical role of olfaction in communication and reveals that social scents can impact sleep.},

 abstract = {People's choices are often found to be inconsistent with the assumptions of rational choice theory. Over time, several probabilistic models have been proposed that account for such deviations from rationality. However, these models have become increasingly complex and are often limited to particular choice phenomena. Here we introduce a network approach that explains a broad set of choice phenomena. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to compare different choice theories and integrates several choice mechanisms from established models. A basic setup implements bounded rationality, loss aversion, and inhibition in a natural fashion, which allows us to predict the occurrence of well-known choice phenomena, such as the endowment effect and the similarity, attraction, compromise, and phantom context effects. Our results show that this network approach provides a simple representation of complex choice behaviour, and can be used to gain a better understanding of how the many choice phenomena and key theoretical principles from different types of decision-making are connected.},

Subsequent studies investigating the role of OT in the trust game found inconclusive effects on the trusting behaviour of investors but these studies deviated from the Kosfeld et al. study in an important way-they did not implement minimal social contact (MSC) between the investors and the trustees in the trust game. Here, we performed a large double-blind and placebo-controlled replication study of the effects of OT on trusting behaviour that yields a power of more than 95{\%} and implements an MSC condition as well as a no-social-contact (NoC) condition. We find no effect of OT on trusting behaviour in the MSC condition. Exploratory post hoc analyses suggest that OT may increase trust in individuals with a low disposition to trust in the NoC condition, but this finding requires confirmation in future research.},

 abstract = {Few studies have analyzed the behaviors of consumers in relation to their purchase of meat products produced with animal welfare in consideration under different decoy scenarios; thus, it is difficult to accurately understand consumer behaviors and to reduce the bias in the conclusions of this study regarding consumption preferences in relation to meat products that had been produced with animal welfare in consideration. With the frequent occurrence of cases connected with the quality and safety of meat in China, the welfare conditions of livestock and poultry urgently need to be improved. We used 810 consumers in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China as our study sample, chose pigs and chickens, i.e., the two common species of livestock and poultry, as study cases, and set four types of decoy scenarios based on breeding time, breeding model, diet cleanliness label, and price attributes, to explore the purchasing options of consumers for meat produced with high levels of animal welfare, under different decoy conditions. A decoy effect was observed in a bounded rational consumption situation in relation to the purchasing behaviors of both chicken and pork. In a situation of chicken purchase, the decoy effect of the breeding model was the strongest, followed by that of price, diet cleanliness label, and breeding time. In the case of pork purchase, the decoy effect of the diet cleanliness label was the strongest, followed by price, breeding model, and breeding time. In a comprehensive comparison between the two types of consumption experiments, price decoy constantly played a significant role, while the decoy effect of breeding time was the weakest. Accordingly, we proposed that in addition to strengthening the knowledge of people in the welfare of livestock and poultry, designing a breeding model decoy or price decoy in the process of chicken sales and designing a diet cleanliness label decoy or price decoy in the process of pork sales can guide the demand of consumers for meat produced with high levels of animal welfare. The welfare of livestock and poultry should thus be improved.},

@article{Anglim.2020,
 abstract = {This study reports the most comprehensive assessment to date of the relations that the domains and facets of Big Five and HEXACO personality have with self-reported subjective well-being (SWB: life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) and psychological well-being (PWB: positive relations, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and personal growth). It presents a meta-analysis (n = 334,567, k = 462) of the correlations of Big Five and HEXACO personality domains with the dimensions of SWB and PWB. It provides the first meta-analysis of personality and well-being to examine (a) HEXACO personality, (b) PWB dimensions, and (c) a broad range of established Big Five measures. It also provides the first robust synthesis of facet-level correlations and incremental prediction by facets over domains in relation to SWB and PWB using 4 large data sets comprising data from prominent, long-form hierarchical personality frameworks: NEO PI-R (n = 1,673), IPIP-NEO (n = 903), HEXACO PI-R (n = 465), and Big Five Aspect Scales (n = 706). Meta-analytic results highlighted the importance of Big Five neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. The pattern of correlations between Big Five personality and SWB was similar across personality measures (e.g., BFI, NEO, IPIP, BFAS, Adjectives). In the HEXACO model, extraversion was the strongest well-being correlate. Facet-level analyses provided a richer description of the relationship between personality and well-being, and clarified differences between the two trait frameworks. Prediction by facets was typically around 20{\%} better than domains, and this incremental prediction was larger for some well-being dimensions than others.

@article{Aryani.2020,
 abstract = {Prior investigations have demonstrated that people tend to link pseudowords such as bouba to rounded shapes and kiki to spiky shapes, but the cognitive processes underlying this matching bias have remained controversial. Here, we present three experiments underscoring the fundamental role of emotional mediation in this sound-shape mapping. Using stimuli from key previous studies, we found that kiki-like pseudowords and spiky shapes, compared with bouba-like pseudowords and rounded shapes, consistently elicit higher levels of affective arousal, which we assessed through both subjective ratings (Experiment 1, N = 52) and acoustic models implemented on the basis of pseudoword material (Experiment 2, N = 70). Crucially, the mediating effect of arousal generalizes to novel pseudowords (Experiment 3, N = 64, which was preregistered). These findings highlight the role that human emotion may play in language development and evolution by grounding associations between abstract concepts (e.g., shapes) and linguistic signs (e.g., words) in the affective system.},

Using a risky foraging task, we investigated individual differences in this dynamic across 781 individuals aged 14-24 years who were split into a hypothesis-generating discovery sample and a hold-out confirmation sample. Sex was the most important predictor of cautious behaviour and performance. Males earned one standard deviation (or 20{\%}) more reward than females, collected more reward when there was little to lose and reduced foraging to the same level as females when potential losses became high. Other independent predictors of cautiousness and performance were self-reported daringness, IQ and self-reported cognitive complexity. We found no evidence for an impact of age or maturation. Thus, maleness, a high IQ or self-reported cognitive complexity, and self-reported daringness predicted greater success in risky foraging, possibly due to better exploitation of low-risk opportunities in high-risk environments.},

@article{Baird.2020,
 abstract = {Despite extensive evidence that time perspective is associated with a range of important outcomes across a variety of life domains (e.g., health, education, wealth), the question of why time perspective has such wide-reaching effects remains unknown. The present review proposes that self-regulatory processes can offer insight into why time perspective is linked to outcomes. To test this idea we classified measures of time perspective according to the dimension of time perspective that they reflected (e.g., past, present-hedonistic, future) and measures of self-regulation according to the self-regulatory process (i.e., goal setting, goal monitoring, and goal operating), ability, or outcome that they reflected. A systematic search identified 378 studies, reporting 2,000 tests of the associations between measures of time perspective and self-regulation. Random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation found that a future time perspective had small-to-medium-sized positive associations with goal setting (r+ = 0.25), goal monitoring (r+ = 0.19), goal operating (r+ = 0.24), self-regulatory ability (r+ = 0.35), and outcomes (r+ = 0.18). Present time perspective, including being present-hedonistic and present-fatalistic, was negatively associated with self-regulatory processes, ability, and outcomes (r+ ranged from -0.00 to -0.27). Meta-analytic mediation models found that the relationship between future time perspective and outcomes was mediated by goal monitoring, goal operating, and self-regulatory ability, but not goal setting. As the first test of why time perspective is associated with key outcomes, the findings highlight the central role of self-regulation processes and abilities for understanding why people with certain time perspectives experience better outcomes.

@article{Ballesta.2020,
 abstract = {In the eighteenth century, Daniel Bernoulli, Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham proposed that economic choices rely on the computation and comparison of subjective values1. This hypothesis continues to inform modern economic theory2 and research in behavioural economics3, but behavioural measures are ultimately not sufficient to verify the proposal4. Consistent with the hypothesis, when agents make choices, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods5. Value-encoding cells integrate multiple dimensions6-9, variability in the activity of each cell group correlates with variability in choices10,11 and the population dynamics suggests the formation of a decision12. However, it is unclear whether these neural processes are causally related to choices. More generally, the evidence linking economic choices to value signals in the brain13-15 remains correlational16. Here we show that neuronal activity in the OFC is causal to economic choices. We conducted two experiments using electrical stimulation in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Low-current stimulation increased the subjective value of individual offers and thus predictably biased choices. Conversely, high-current stimulation disrupted both the computation and the comparison of subjective values, and thus increased choice variability. These results demonstrate a causal chain linking subjective values encoded in OFC to valuation and choice.},

@article{Cataldo.2020,
 abstract = {Research on reference points highlights how alternatives outside the choice set can alter the perceived value of available alternatives, arguably framing the choice scenario. The present work utilizes reference points to study the effects of framing in preferential choice, using the similarity and attraction context effects as performance measures. We specifically test the predictions of Multialternative Decision by Sampling (MDbS; Noguchi {\&} Stewart, 2018), a recent preferential choice model that can account for both reference points and context effects. In Experiment 1, consistent with predictions by MDbS, we find a standard similarity effect when no reference point is given that increases when both dimensions are framed negatively and decreases when both dimensions are framed positively. Contrary to predictions by MDbS, when the two dimensions are framed as tradeoffs, participants prefer whichever alternative performs best in the negatively framed dimension. Performance of MDbS was improved by the addition of a frame-based global attention allocation mechanism. Experiment 2 extends these results to a {\textquotedbl}by-dimension{\textquotedbl} presentation format in an attempt to bring participant behavior in line with MDbS assumptions. The empirical and modeling results replicated those of Experiment 1. Experiment 3 used the attraction effect to test the effects of framing when the best-performing alternative on each dimension was identical across target conditions, therefore reducing the potential effects of a global attention allocation mechanism. The effects of framing were indeed greatly reduced, and the performance of MDbS was markedly improved. The results extend framing to the context effects literature, provide new benchmarks for models and theories of context effects, and point to the need for a global attention mechanism.},

In a blindfolded memory test, they indicated which of two objects from the same basic-level category (e.g., two different pens) had been touched before. As shown in Experiment 1 ( N = 26), memory was nearly perfect when tested immediately after exploration (94{\%}) and still high when tested after 1 week (85{\%}). As shown in Experiment 2 ( N = 43), when participants explored the objects without the intention to memorize them, memory in a 1-week delayed surprise test was still high (79{\%}), even when assessed with a cross-modal visual memory test (73{\%}). These results indicate that detailed, durable, long-term memory representations are stored as a natural product of haptic perception.},

 abstract = {Pupil diameter and microsaccades are captured by an eye tracker and compared for their suitability as indicators of cognitive load (as beset by task difficulty). Specifically, two metrics are tested in response to task difficulty: (1) the change in pupil diameter with respect to inter- or intra-trial baseline, and (2) the rate and magnitude of microsaccades. Participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target. Inter-trial change in pupil diameter and microsaccade magnitude appear to adequately discriminate task difficulty, and hence cognitive load, if the implied causality can be assumed. This paper's contribution corroborates previous work concerning microsaccade magnitude and extends this work by directly comparing microsaccade metrics to pupillometric measures. To our knowledge this is the first study to compare the reliability and sensitivity of task-evoked pupillary and microsaccadic measures of cognitive load.},

@article{Krol.2018,
 abstract = {We investigated the effect of auditory noise added to speech on patterns of looking at faces in 40 toddlers. We hypothesised that noise would increase the difficulty of processing speech, making children allocate more attention to the mouth of the speaker to gain visual speech cues from mouth movements. We also hypothesised that this shift would cause a decrease in fixation time to the eyes, potentially decreasing the ability to monitor gaze. We found that adding noise increased the number of fixations to the mouth area, at the price of a decreased number of fixations to the eyes. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a mouth-eyes trade-off between attention allocated to social cues coming from the eyes and linguistic cues coming from the mouth. We also found that children with higher word recognition proficiency and higher average pupil response had an increased likelihood of fixating the mouth, compared to the eyes and the rest of the screen, indicating stronger motivation to decode the speech.},

 abstract = {It is a widespread concern that violent video games promote aggression, reduce pro-social behaviour, increase impulsivity and interfere with cognition as well as mood in its players. Previous experimental studies have focussed on short-term effects of violent video gameplay on aggression, yet there are reasons to believe that these effects are mostly the result of priming. In contrast, the present study is the first to investigate the effects of long-term violent video gameplay using a large battery of tests spanning questionnaires, behavioural measures of aggression, sexist attitudes, empathy and interpersonal competencies, impulsivity-related constructs (such as sensation seeking, boredom proneness, risk taking, delay discounting), mental health (depressivity, anxiety) as well as executive control functions, before and after 2 months of gameplay. Our participants played the violent video game Grand Theft Auto V, the non-violent video game The Sims 3 or no game at all for 2 months on a daily basis. No significant changes were observed, neither when comparing the group playing a violent video game to a group playing a non-violent game, nor to a passive control group. Also, no effects were observed between baseline and posttest directly after the intervention, nor between baseline and a follow-up assessment 2 months after the intervention period had ended. The present results thus provide strong evidence against the frequently debated negative effects of playing violent video games in adults and will therefore help to communicate a more realistic scientific perspective on the effects of violent video gaming.},

@article{Lachowicz.2018,
 abstract = {Mediation analysis has become one of the most popular statistical methods in the social sciences. However, many currently available effect size measures for mediation have limitations that restrict their use to specific mediation models. In this article, we develop a measure of effect size that addresses these limitations. We show how modification of a currently existing effect size measure results in a novel effect size measure with many desirable properties. We also derive an expression for the bias of the sample estimator for the proposed effect size measure and propose an adjusted version of the estimator. We present a Monte Carlo simulation study conducted to examine the finite sampling properties of the adjusted and unadjusted estimators, which shows that the adjusted estimator is effective at recovering the true value it estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the effect size measure with an empirical example. We provide freely available software so that researchers can immediately implement the methods we discuss. Our developments here extend the existing literature on effect sizes and mediation by developing a potentially useful method of communicating the magnitude of mediation. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that we commonly fail to notice suprathreshold environmental olfactory stimuli. The determinants of olfactory awareness are, as yet, unknown. Here, we adapted the inattentional-blindness paradigm to test whether olfactory awareness is dependent on attention. Across three experiments, participants performed a visual search task with either a high or low perceptual load (a well-established attentional manipulation) while exposed to an ambient coffee aroma. Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that task load modulated olfactory awareness: 42.5{\%} fewer participants in the high- than in the low-load condition reported noticing the coffee aroma. Our final experiment demonstrates that because of unique characteristics of olfactory habituation, the consequences of inattentional anosmia can persist even once attention becomes available. These findings establish the phenomenon of inattentional anosmia and have applied implications for predicting when people may miss potentially important olfactory information.},

Using standard sensory evaluation techniques with untrained consumers we have validated a preliminary olfactory lexicon for dried cannabis flower, and characterized the aroma profile of eleven strains sold in the legal recreational market in Colorado. We show that consumers perceive differences among strains, that the strains form distinct clusters based on odor similarity, and that strain aroma profiles are linked to perceptions of potency, price, and smoking interest.},

@article{Hilbe.2018,
 abstract = {Social dilemmas occur when incentives for individuals are misaligned with group interests1-7. According to the 'tragedy of the commons', these misalignments can lead to overexploitation and collapse of public resources. The resulting behaviours can be analysed with the tools of game theory8. The theory of direct reciprocity9-15 suggests that repeated interactions can alleviate such dilemmas, but previous work has assumed that the public resource remains constant over time. Here we introduce the idea that the public resource is instead changeable and depends on the strategic choices of individuals. An intuitive scenario is that cooperation increases the public resource, whereas defection decreases it. Thus, cooperation allows the possibility of playing a more valuable game with higher payoffs, whereas defection leads to a less valuable game. We analyse this idea using the theory of stochastic games16-19 and evolutionary game theory. We find that the dependence of the public resource on previous interactions can greatly enhance the propensity for cooperation. For these results, the interaction between reciprocity and payoff feedback is crucial: neither repeated interactions in a constant environment nor single interactions in a changing environment yield similar cooperation rates. Our framework shows which feedbacks between exploitation and environment-either naturally occurring or designed-help to overcome social dilemmas.},

 abstract = {When estimating unknown quantities, people insufficiently adjust from values they have previously considered, a phenomenon known as anchoring. We suggest that anchoring is at least partially caused by a desire to avoid making extreme adjustments. In seven studies ( N = 5,279), we found that transparently irrelevant cues of extremeness influenced people's adjustments from anchors. In Studies 1-6, participants were less likely to adjust beyond a particular amount when that amount was closer to the maximum allowable adjustment. For example, in Study 5, participants were less likely to adjust by at least 6 units when they were allowed to adjust by a maximum of 6 units than by a maximum of 15 units. In Study 7, participants adjusted less after considering whether an outcome would be within a smaller distance of the anchor. These results suggest that anchoring effects may reflect a desire to avoid adjustments that feel too extreme.},

 abstract = {This article provides the first test of the decoy effect as a nudge to influence real-world behavior. The decoy effect is the phenomenon that an additional but worse option can boost the appeal of an existing option. It has been widely demonstrated in hypothetical choices, but its usefulness in real-world settings has been subject to debate. In three longitudinal experiments in food-processing factories, we tested two decoy sanitation options that were worse than the existing sanitizer spray bottle. Results showed that the presence of a decoy, but not an additional copy of the original sanitizer bottle in a different color, drastically increased food workers' hand sanitizer use from the original sanitizer bottle and, consequently, improved workers' passing rate in hand sanitary tests from 60{\%} to 70{\%} to above 90{\%} for 20 days. These findings indicate that the decoy effect can be a powerful nudge technique to influence real-world behavior.},

 abstract = {Jackfruit seeds are an under-utilized waste product in many tropical countries. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of roasted jackfruit seeds to substitute for cocoa powder in cappuccino formulations. Two different flours were produced from a hard variety jackfruit by drying or fermenting the seeds prior to roasting. Next, formulations were prepared with 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%} substitution of cocoa powder with jackfruit seed flours, totalizing seven with control formulation. The acceptance of cappuccinos by consumers (n = 126) and quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA{\circledR}) were used to describe the preparations. Physicochemical properties were also evaluated. When 50{\%} and 75{\%} cocoa powder was replaced with dry jackfruit seed flour, there was no change in sensory acceptability or technological properties; however, it is possible to identify advantages tousing dry jackfruit seed flour, including moisture reduction and high wettability, solubility and sensory acceptation of the chocolate aroma. The principal component analysis of QDA explained90{\%} variances; cluster analysis enabled the definition of four groups for six cappuccino preparations. In fact, dry jackfruit seed flour is an innovative cocoa powder substitute; it could be used in food preparations, consequently utilizing this tropical fruit waste by incorporating it as an ingredient in a common product of the human diet.},

Recent research has demonstrated that hypobaric pressure impairs gustatory function and that background noise or distracting auditory stimulation impairs olfactory function. Using a hypobaric chamber, the odor identification, discrimination, and thresholds as well as taste identification and threshold scores were measured in 16 healthy male volunteers under normal and hypobaric (6380 ft) conditions using clinically validated tests. In both conditions, background noise was either canceled out or replaced by white noise presentation (70 dB sound pressure level). Olfactory sensitivity for n-butanol and gustatory sensitivity were impaired in a hypobaric atmosphere. White noise did not influence the odor test results. White noise stimulation impaired sensitivity for sour and sweet but not for bitter or salty tastants. We conclude that hypobaric or noisy environments could impair gustatory and olfactory sensitivity selectively for particular tastants and odorants.},

 abstract = {The prevalence rate of obesity continues to rise in the U.S., but effective treatment options remain elusive resulting in increased emphasis on prevention. One such area of prevention research capitalizes on the relatively novel behavioral construct of food addiction, which has been implicated in obesity. Food addiction reflects an individual's propensity for compulsive eating despite negative consequences, and shares not only symptoms with both eating and substance use disorders but also genetic and neural correlates within neural reward-circuitry modulated by dopamine. Here, we examined associations between food addiction scores, body mass index (BMI), reward-related ventral striatum activity, and a polygenic score approximating dopamine signaling in 115 non-Hispanic Caucasian young adult university students. As predicted, polygenic dopamine scores were related to ventral striatum activity, which in turn was associated with higher food addiction scores. In addition, food addiction was related to BMI. An exploratory post-hoc path analysis further indicated that polygenic scores were indirectly related to both food addiction and BMI, in part, through ventral striatum activity. Collectively, our results provide evidence supporting the utility of food addiction in weight gain prevention research by establishing links with known risk-related neural and genetic biomarkers.},

 abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) are not exclusively expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons; they are also observed outside of the olfactory system in all other human tissues tested to date, including the testis, lung, intestine, skin, heart, and blood. Within these tissues, certain ORs have been determined to be exclusively expressed in only one tissue, whereas other ORs are more widely distributed in many different tissues throughout the human body. For most of the ectopically expressed ORs, limited data are available for their functional roles. They have been shown to be involved in the modulation of cell-cell recognition, migration, proliferation, the apoptotic cycle, exocytosis, and pathfinding processes. Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence that they have the potential to serve as diagnostic and therapeutic tools, as ORs are highly expressed in different cancer tissues. Interestingly, in addition to the canonical signaling pathways activated by ORs in olfactory sensory neurons, alternative pathways have been demonstrated in nonolfactory tissues. In this review, the existing data concerning the expression, as well as the physiological and pathophysiological functions, of ORs outside of the nose are highlighted to provide insights into future lines of research.},

 abstract = {Research over the past decade has shown that various personality traits are communicated through musical preferences. One limitation of that research is external validity, as most studies have assessed individual differences in musical preferences using self-reports of music-genre preferences. Are personality traits communicated through behavioral manifestations of musical preferences? We addressed this question in two large-scale online studies with demographically diverse populations. Study 1 ( N = 22,252) shows that reactions to unfamiliar musical excerpts predicted individual differences in personality-most notably, openness and extraversion-above and beyond demographic characteristics. Moreover, these personality traits were differentially associated with particular music-preference dimensions. The results from Study 2 ( N = 21,929) replicated and extended these findings by showing that an active measure of naturally occurring behavior, Facebook Likes for musical artists, also predicted individual differences in personality. In general, our findings establish the robustness and external validity of the links between musical preferences and personality.},

 abstract = {Five experiments (Ntotal ~=~2,503) tested the attraction effect and its boundary conditions in the context of helping behaviour. Participants could choose one donation appeal in a set of either two or three alternatives. The three alternatives set included a decoy - an alternative that resembled but was clearly inferior to a target (i.e., the most beneficial) alternative. A clear and consistent pattern emerged: Participants chose the target alternative more frequently and perceived it as more beneficial (and somewhat less costly) when the decoy was present compared to when it was absent. This finding was robust when the attribute ratings of the alternatives were unclear, when the target alternative offered a bundle of unrelated products, and when participants could refrain from donating altogether, or contribute any amount they wished. Our findings offer concrete and simple strategies that charities can implement at zero cost to increase giving and the perceived benefits that people's good deed bring about to those in need.},

@article{Miller.2019,
 abstract = {Habits form a crucial component of behavior. In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.

@article{Luca.2019,
 abstract = {Previous research demonstrates that odors affect consumers' behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses to products and environments. Sensory and scent research have prioritized an emotional approach in which consumer responses are primarily affective reactions to smells. However, individuals' perceptions of their environment are frequently regulated by an unconscious mechanism that does not necessarily involve rational thinking. Therefore, their responses to odors may result from automatic and unconscious cognitive processes that occur without their awareness. We propose that the unconscious odor interpretation better regulates consumers' responses to odors and behaviors than emotions and that the way in which olfactory information is cognitively processed and integrated into knowledge may address the extent to which odors help individuals to perceive their environment holistically and attribute meanings to events and social phenomena. Through a systematic review of 55 empirical studies on olfaction, we i) discuss the current theoretical approaches to scent marketing and the most relevant empirical findings; ii) propose a cognition-based framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms through which odors are mentally processed to influence consumers' behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses; and iii) develop a research agenda to encourage further studies on the cognitive processing of scents.},

 abstract = {Heuristics are simple, yet effective, strategies that people use to make decisions. Because heuristics do not require all available information, they are thought to be easy to implement and to not tax limited cognitive resources, which has led heuristics to be characterized as fast-and-frugal. We question this monolithic conception of heuristics by contrasting the cognitive demands of two popular heuristics, Tallying and Take-the-Best. We contend that heuristics that are frugal in terms of information usage may not always be fast because of the attentional control required to implement this focus in certain contexts. In support of this hypothesis, we find that Take-the-Best, while being more frugal in terms of information usage, is slower to implement and fares worse under time pressure manipulations than Tallying. This effect is then reversed when search costs for Take-the-Best are reduced by changing the format of the stimuli. These findings suggest that heuristics are heterogeneous and should be unpacked according to their cognitive demands to determine the circumstances a heuristic best applies.

 abstract = {A context effect is a change in preference that occurs when alternatives are added to a choice set. Models of preferential choice that account for context effects largely assume a within-dimension comparison process. It has been shown, however, that the format in which a choice set is presented can influence comparison strategies. That is, a by-alternative or by-dimension grouping of the dimension values encourage within-alternative or within-dimension comparisons, respectively. For example, one classic context effect, the compromise effect, is strengthened by a by-dimension presentation format. Extrapolation from this result suggests that a second context effect, the similarity effect, will actually reverse when stimuli are presented in a by-dimension format. In the current study, we presented participants with a series of apartment choice sets designed to elicit the similarity effect, with either a by-alternative or by-dimension presentation format. Participants in the by-alternative condition demonstrated a standard similarity effect; however, participants in the by-dimension condition demonstrated a strong reverse similarity effect. The present data can be accounted for by Multialternative Decision Field Theory (MDFT) and the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator (MLBA), but not Elimination by Aspects (EBA). Indeed, when some weak assumptions of within-dimension processes are met, MDFT and the MLBA predict the reverse similarity effect. These modeling results suggest that the similarity effect is governed by either forgetting and inhibition (MDFT), or attention to positive or negative differences (MLBA). These results demonstrate that flexibility in the comparison process needs to be incorporated into theories of preferential choice.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Given a set of features, researchers are often interested in partitioning objects into homogeneous clusters. In health research, cancer research in particular, high-throughput data is collected with the aim of segmenting patients into sub-populations to aid in disease diagnosis, prognosis or response to therapy. Cluster analysis, a class of unsupervised learning techniques, is often used for class discovery. Cluster analysis suffers from some limitations, including the need to select up-front the algorithm to be used as well as the number of clusters to generate, in addition, there may exist several groupings consistent with the data, making it very difficult to validate a final solution. Ensemble clustering is a technique used to mitigate these limitations and facilitate the generalization and reproducibility of findings in new cohorts of patients.

RESULTS

We introduce diceR (diverse cluster ensemble in R), a software package available on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diceR CONCLUSIONS: diceR is designed to provide a set of tools to guide researchers through a general cluster analysis process that relies on minimizing subjective decision-making. Although developed in a biological context, the tools in diceR are data-agnostic and thus can be applied in different contexts.},

Why individuals with ASD misread emotions remains unclear. Given that terrestrial mammals rely on their sense of smell to read conspecific emotions, we hypothesized that misreading of emotional cues in ASD partially reflects altered social chemosignaling. We found no difference between typically developed (TD) and cognitively able adults with ASD at explicit detection and perception of social chemosignals. Nevertheless, TD and ASD participants dissociated in their responses to subliminal presentation of these same compounds: the undetected 'smell of fear' (skydiver sweat) increased physiological arousal and reduced explicit and implicit measures of trust in TD but acted opposite in ASD participants. Moreover, two different undetected synthetic putative social chemosignals increased or decreased arousal in TD but acted opposite in ASD participants. These results implicate social chemosignaling as a sensory substrate of social impairment in ASD.},

@article{Soekhai.2019,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly advocated as a way to quantify preferences for health. However, increasing support does not necessarily result in increasing quality. Although specific reviews have been conducted in certain contexts, there exists no recent description of the general state of the science of health-related DCEs. The aim of this paper was to update prior reviews (1990-2012), to identify all health-related DCEs and to provide a description of trends, current practice and future challenges.

METHODS

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify health-related empirical DCEs published between 2013 and 2017. The search strategy and data extraction replicated prior reviews to allow the reporting of trends, although additional extraction fields were incorporated.

RESULTS

Of the 7877 abstracts generated, 301 studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent data extraction. In general, the total number of DCEs per year continued to increase, with broader areas of application and increased geographic scope. Studies reported using more sophisticated designs (e.g. D-efficient) with associated software (e.g. Ngene). The trend towards using more sophisticated econometric models also continued. However, many studies presented sophisticated methods with insufficient detail. Qualitative research methods continued to be a popular approach for identifying attributes and levels.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of empirical DCEs in health economics continues to grow. However, inadequate reporting of methodological details inhibits quality assessment. This may reduce decision-makers' confidence in results and their ability to act on the findings. How and when to integrate health-related DCE outcomes into decision-making remains an important area for future research.},

 abstract = {The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait-outcome associations. Overall, 87{\%} of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77{\%} as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait-outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have shown that a large proportion of women invited for bowel cancer screening prefer endoscopists of the same gender. We tested whether women who are initially disinclined to undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy screening would be more willing to have the test with a female practitioner if they were also offered a decoy appointment with a male practitioner. We conducted two online experiments with women aged 35-54, living in England, who did not intend to undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy screening. In both experiments, women were randomised to two conditions: (1) control (appointment with a female endoscopist) and (2) decoy (two appointments to choose from, one with a male endoscopist and one with a female endoscopist). Experiment 1 (N = 302) verified the conditions for the decoy using a conventional intention scale, while experiment 2 (N = 300) tested how the presence of the decoy influences the likelihood of women choosing the appointment with the female practitioner in a discrete choice task. While experiment 1 showed that the presence of the decoy increased intentions to attend the appointment with the female practitioner (p = 0.02), experiment 2 confirmed that women were more likely to choose the appointment with the female endoscopist if they were also offered the decoy (p {\textless} 0.001). In both experiments, the presence of the decoy decreased perceived difficulty of the screening decision and cognitive effort required to make the decision. Offering disinclined women a male practitioner increased intention to have the test with an endoscopist of the same gender. This suggests that male screening practitioners can be used as decoy options to increase the likelihood that women choose female practitioners and facilitate the screening decision.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The role of cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making is of growing interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whether studies on cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making are based on actual or hypothetical decisions and are conducted with populations that are representative of those who typically make the medical decision; to categorize the types of cognitive biases and heuristics found and whether they are found in patients or in medical personnel; and to critically review the studies based on standard methodological quality criteria.

METHOD

Data sources were original, peer-reviewed, empirical studies on cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making found in Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, and the CINAHL databases published in 1980-2013. Predefined exclusion criteria were used to identify 213 studies. During data extraction, information was collected on type of bias or heuristic studied, respondent population, decision type, study type (actual or hypothetical), study method, and study conclusion.

RESULTS

Of the 213 studies analyzed, 164 (77{\%}) were based on hypothetical vignettes, and 175 (82{\%}) were conducted with representative populations. Nineteen types of cognitive biases and heuristics were found. Only 34{\%} of studies (n = 73) investigated medical personnel, and 68{\%} (n = 145) confirmed the presence of a bias or heuristic. Each methodological quality criterion was satisfied by more than 50{\%} of the studies, except for sample size and validated instruments/questions. Limitations are that existing terms were used to inform search terms, and study inclusion criteria focused strictly on decision making.

CONCLUSIONS

Most of the studies on biases and heuristics in medical decision making are based on hypothetical vignettes, raising concerns about applicability of these findings to actual decision making. Biases and heuristics have been underinvestigated in medical personnel compared with patients.},

 abstract = {As the rise of tablets and smartphones move the dominant interface for digital content from mouse or trackpad to direct touchscreen interaction, work is needed to explore the role of interfaces in shaping psychological reactions to online content. This research explores the role of direct-touch interfaces in product search and choice, and isolates the touch element from other form factor changes such as screen size. Results from an experimental study using a travel recommendation Web site show that a direct-touch interface (vs. a more traditional mouse interface) increases the number of alternatives searched, and biases evaluations toward tangible attributes such as d{\'e}cor and furniture over intangible attributes such as WiFi and employee demeanor. Direct-touch interfaces also elevate the importance of internal and subjective satisfaction metrics such as instinct over external and objective metrics such as reviews, which in turn increases anticipated satisfaction metrics. Findings suggest that interfaces can strongly affect how online content is explored, perceived, remembered, and acted on, and further work in interface psychology could be as fruitful as research exploring the content itself.},

One aspect of the information age has been the novel concerns deriving from advanced IT technology--which include Internet addiction, gambling, and so on. These Internet-based problems have emerged in many countries, including South Korea. In an effort to solve this problem, the South Korean government has created a variety of programs designed to cure teenagers' Internet addictions, most notably the Jump Up Internet Rescue School, a camp designed to cure Internet-addicted or online game-addicted children. In this study, we review this boot-camp program and present a brief review of the literature concerning Internet addiction and habit theory. Additionally, we provide some useful implications for the Korean government and other countries, practitioners, and researchers. It is also anticipated that the findings from this study will provide us with a better understanding of how case-study-based research into Internet addiction curative programs can be regarded as a burgeoning field of Internet-related research.},

 abstract = {Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are virtual communities where users can create individual public profiles, interact with real-life friends, and meet other people based on shared interests. They are seen as a 'global consumer phenomenon' with an exponential rise in usage within the last few years. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that 'addiction' to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is scarce. Therefore, this literature review is intended to provide empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to SNSs by: (1) outlining SNS usage patterns, (2) examining motivations for SNS usage, (3) examining personalities of SNS users, (4) examining negative consequences of SNS usage, (5) exploring potential SNS addiction, and (6) exploring SNS addiction specificity and comorbidity. The findings indicate that SNSs are predominantly used for social purposes, mostly related to the maintenance of established offline networks. Moreover, extraverts appear to use social networking sites for social enhancement, whereas introverts use it for social compensation, each of which appears to be related to greater usage, as does low conscientiousness and high narcissism. Negative correlates of SNS usage include the decrease in real life social community participation and academic achievement, as well as relationship problems, each of which may be indicative of potential addiction.},

@article{Latty.2011,
 abstract = {Most models of animal foraging and consumer choice assume that individuals make choices based on the absolute value of items and are therefore `economically rational'. However, frequent violations of rationality by animals, including humans, suggest that animals use comparative valuation rules. Are comparative valuation strategies a consequence of the way brains process information, or are they an intrinsic feature of biological decision-making? Here, we examine the principles of rationality in an organism with radically different information-processing mechanisms: the brainless, unicellular, slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We offered P. polycephalum amoebas a choice between food options that varied in food quality and light exposure (P. polycephalum is photophobic). The use of an absolute valuation rule will lead to two properties: transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Transitivity is satisfied if preferences have a consistent, linear ordering, while IIA states that a decision maker's preference for an item should not change if the choice set is expanded. A violation of either of these principles suggests the use of comparative rather than absolute valuation rules. Physarum polycephalum satisfied transitivity by having linear preference rankings. However, P. polycephalum's preference for a focal alternative increased when a third, inferior quality option was added to the choice set, thus violating IIA and suggesting the use of a comparative valuation process. The discovery of comparative valuation rules in a unicellular organism suggests that comparative valuation rules are ubiquitous, if not universal, among biological decision makers.},

identification of a dimension on which options differ, followed by an

analysis of the factors that influence preferences along that dimension.

Building on a conceptual analysis of a diverse set of problems, the

authors identify a class of related consumers choices (e.g., extreme vs.

compromise, hedonic vs. utilitarian, risky vs. safe) that can all be

classified according to their levels of self- versus other-expression (or

[un]conventionality). as shown in four studies, these problem types

respond similarly to manipulations that trigger or suppress selfexpression.

Specifically, priming self-expression systematically increases

the share of the self-expressive options across choice problems.

conversely, expecting to be evaluated decreases the share of the selfexpressive

options across the various choice dilemmas. in addition,

priming risk seeking increases only the choice of risky gambles but not of

other self-expressive options. these findings highlight the importance of

seeking underlying shared features across different consumer choice

problems, instead of treating each type in isolation.},

However, it is not known if it is applicable to products that people usually touch for brief periods of time. This study sets out to explore whether it is possible to influence consumers' tactile perception of fast-moving consumer goods by altering the surface texture. In this study individual tactile sensing and visual appreciation were compared with the combined visual and tactile sensing of surface textures for two types of products (soap and biscuits). Three types of textures on the outside of either a soap or biscuit box and three separate sample swatches of the textures used on the boxes were used in the study. The three soap or biscuit boxes were visually presented to the participants. This was followed by a blind haptic evaluation of the three textures, and then by a combined visual and tactile evaluation of three differently textured boxes (either soap or biscuit boxes). The results suggest that a consumer's perception of the packaging of fast-moving consumer goods is affected more by vision than by touch, which raises some questions with regard to when marketers should encourage consumers to engage in extensive tactile interaction prior to purchase.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). NHST has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

Participants (N = 124) completed a personality inventory (NEO-FFI) and underwent assessment of olfactory, trigeminal, tactile and gustatory detection thresholds, as well as examination of trigeminal and tactile pain thresholds. Significantly enhanced odor sensitivity in socially agreeable people, significantly enhanced trigeminal sensitivity in neurotic subjects, and a tendency for enhanced pain tolerance in highly conscientious participants was revealed. It is postulated that varied sensory processing may influence an individual's perception of the environment; particularly their perception of socially relevant or potentially dangerous stimuli and thus, varied with personality.},

 abstract = {Joint space multidimensional scaling maps are often utilized for positioning analyses and are estimated on survey samples of consumer preferences, choices, considerations, or intentions so as to provide a concise spatial depiction of the competitive landscape including relevant dimensions or attributes, competing brands, and consumers in the same joint space representation. Care has to be given concerning the underlying scale properties of such survey data so as not to distort the resulting joint space positioning map. We present a new joint space multidimensional scaling procedure for positioning analyses for displaying the structure in such survey data when such common ordered successive category measurement scales such as Likert, Edwards, semantic differential, etc., are employed. We present the technical details of this stochastic ordered preference multidimensional scaling vector model as well as the maximum likelihood estimation-based algorithm devised for parameter estimation. Favorable comparisons are made with several existent multidimensional scaling methods in representing the internal structure for such data in marketing positioning studies. An actual commercial positioning application concerning large sports utility vehicles consideration to buy judgments is presented with predictive validation comparisons with other multidimensional scaling joint space procedures.},

@article{Gigerenzer.2011,
 abstract = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do {\textquotedbl}rational{\textquotedbl} decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question ({\textquotedbl}Which heuristics do people use in which situations?{\textquotedbl}) and the prescriptive question ({\textquotedbl}When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?{\textquotedbl}), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

 abstract = {Deciding when to leave a depleting resource to exploit another is a fundamental problem for all decision makers. The neuronal mechanisms mediating patch-leaving decisions remain unknown. We found that neurons in primate (Macaca mulatta) dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, an area that is linked to reward monitoring and executive control, encode a decision variable signaling the relative value of leaving a depleting resource for a new one. Neurons fired during each sequential decision to stay in a patch and, for each travel time, these responses reached a fixed threshold for patch-leaving. Longer travel times reduced the gain of neural responses for choosing to stay in a patch and increased the firing rate threshold mandating patch-leaving. These modulations more closely matched behavioral decisions than any single task variable. These findings portend an understanding of the neural basis of foraging decisions and endorse the unification of theoretical and experimental work in ecology and neuroscience.},

 abstract = {A large and growing body of evidence from marketing and behavioral economics suggests consumer preferences are not fixed but instead depend on the choice set. Although the idea that context alters perception is not new to psychophysicists or sensory scientists, we suggest that asymmetric dominance may represent a novel and potentially important source of bias in hedonic product testing and food choice research. In a series of six experiments using model systems, commercially available beverages and solid foods, we explored the possibility that asymmetric dominance effects may influence the results of food preference testing. Within a model system (experiments 1--3), we failed to observe evidence of a bias arising from asymmetric dominance. In contrast, when perceptually complex beverages and foods were used (experiments 4--6), we found relative preference was altered by the introduction of an additional product into the choice set. Critically, we found this bias was able to induce a significant preference (experiments 4--5) or make a significant preference disappear (experiment 6). Implications of this potential source of bias are discussed in a context relevant to sensory scientists and product developers.},

One way to differentiate is by providing a pleasant and exciting shopping ambience. This paper experimentally tests the effects of music (volume high or low) and aroma (vanilla scent present/absent) on young fashion shoppers in a real retail setting. Results show that volume of music and the presence of a vanilla aroma both have a significant impact on shoppers' emotions and satisfaction levels. Additional analysis reveals that the arousal induced by music and aroma results in increased pleasure levels, which in turn positively influences shopper behaviors, including time and money spend, approach behavior, and satisfaction with the shopping experience. Direct effects of arousal on behaviors as well as an interaction effect between music and aroma on pleasure and time spent in the store are also present. The paper contributes to the better understanding of shoppers' emotions and shopper behaviors in response to in-store atmospherics and offers retailers practical insights into how to create competitive advantage by customizing the atmosphere in their stores},

All lung donors reported to Eurotransplant from 1999 to 2007 [N = 6080] were used to create a lung donor score. Based on observed discard rates and using multivariate regression, points were assigned for six preprocurement donor variables. Donors reported in 2008 were used to validate the score [N = 751]. All the six factors significantly predicted discard; as an example, the following donor with points: age 55--59 years: 2; compromised history: 4; smoking: 2; shadow on chest X-ray: 2; purulent secretion during bronchoscopy: 2; and Pao2/Fio2 ratio below 300 mmHg: 3. Discard rates for donors with a lung donor score of 6 points (class 1) was 18{\%}, while 36{\%} and 54{\%} of the donors with a score of 7--8 (class 2) and 9 +  (class 3) were discarded (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. In addition, the donor lung score was significantly associated with 1-year survival: class 1: 91{\%}; class 2: 80{\%}; and class 3: 72{\%} (P = 0.017). The lung donor score accurately reflects the likelihood of organ acceptance and predicts patient mortality, and its application at time of donor reporting may facilitate donor risk assessment and patient selection.},

 abstract = {THE AIM OF THE REVIEW: A large number of studies suggest a close relationship between olfactory and affective information processing. Odors can modulate mood, cognition, and behavior. The aim of this article is to summarize the comparative anatomy of central olfactory pathways and centers involved in emotional analysis, in order to shed light on the relationship between the two systems. ANATOMY OF THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM: Odorant contact with the primary olfactory neurons is the starting point of olfactory transduction. The glomerulus of the olfactory bulb is the only relay between the peripheral and central olfactory system. Olfactory information is conducted to the secondary olfactory structures, notably the piriform cortex. The tertiary olfactory structures are the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and insular cortex. THE IMPACT OF ODORS ON AFFECTIVE STATES: Quality of life is commonly impaired in dysosmic patients. There have, however, been few publications on this topic. EMOTION AND OLFACTION: COMMON BRAIN PATHWAYS: There are brain structures common to emotion and odor processing. The present review focuses on such structures: amygdala, hippocampus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. The physiology and anatomy of each of these systems is described and discussed.},

 abstract = {Across a sample of 123 countries, we examined the association between the fulfillment of needs and subjective well-being (SWB), including life evaluation, positive feelings, and negative feelings. Need fulfillment was consistently associated with SWB across world regions. Life evaluation was most associated with fulfilling basic needs; positive feelings were most associated with social and respect needs; and negative feelings were most associated with basic, respect, and autonomy needs. Societal need fulfillment predicted SWB, particularly for life evaluation, beyond individuals' fulfillment of their own needs, indicating the desirability of living in a flourishing society. In addition, the associations of SWB with the fulfillment of specific needs were largely independent of whether other needs were fulfilled. These trends persisted when household income was taken into account. The emergent ordering of need fulfillment for psychosocial needs were fairly consistent across country conditions, but the fulfillment of basic and safety needs were contingent on country membership.},

been virtually no research regarding the genetic basis of consumer judgment

and choice. In this research, we examine a wide range of previously unexplored

heritable effects on consumer choices and judgments. Moreover, whereas prior

research on heritable traits has typically employed a piecemeal approach, demonstrating

each heritable trait separately, we propose an alternative way to simultaneously

explore common mechanisms and links among heritable traits and

behaviors. Using a classic twins study design, we find a large heritable effect

on preferences for (a) compromise (but not dominating) options, (b) sure gains,

(c) an upcoming feasible, dull assignment, (d) maximizing, (e) utilitarian options,

and (f ) certain products. Conversely, we do not find significant heritable effects

regarding judgment heuristics, discounting, and other decision problems. We

tentatively propose that the pattern of findings might reflect a generic heritable

individual difference relating to ``prudence.'' We discuss the implications of our

research with respect to the determinants of preferences and future research

on heritable aspects of judgment and choice.},

 abstract = {Little is known about the influence of visual characteristics other than colour on flavor perception, and the complex interactions between more than two sensory modalities. This study focused on the effects of recognizability of visual (texture) information on flavor perception of odorized sweet beverages. Participants rated the perceived sweetness of odorized sucrose solutions in the presence or absence of either a congruent or incongruent visual context. Odors were qualitatively reminiscent of sweet foods (strawberry and caramel) or not (savoury). Visual context was either an image of the same sweet foods (figurative context) or a visual texture derived from this product (non-figurative context). Textures were created using a texture synthesis method that preserved perceived food qualities while removing object information. Odor-taste combinations were rated sweeter within a figurative than a non-figurative context. This behaviour was exhibited for all odor-taste combinations, even in trials without images, indicating sustained priming by figurative visual context. A non-figurative context showed a transient sweetening effect. Sweetness was generally enhanced most by the strawberry odor. We conclude that the degree of recognizability of visual information (figurative versus non-figurative), influences flavor perception differently. Our results suggest that this visual context priming is mediated by separate sustained and transient processes that are differently evoked by figurative and non-figurative visual contexts. These components operate independent of the congruency of the image-odor-taste combinations.},

In a between-subjects design, we observe the impact of a substantial delay of risk resolution (2 days) on investment choices. Besides the resolution timing all other factors, including the timing of payout, are held constant across treatments. In addition, state-of-the-art experimental techniques from experimental economics and psychology are used for eliciting preferences and to explicitly measure emotions and personality traits. Participants put their own money at stake. Our main finding is that the timing of the resolution of risk matters for investment, modulated by the probability of investment success. Emotions are found to play a significant role in this respect and explain our main finding. Our results support recent models of decision making under risk trying to incorporate anticipatory emotions but also uncover some important shortcomings related to the dynamics of emotions.},

rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence

that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy

it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost,

and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for

It is argued that a zero attribute removes a reference point that consumers use to evaluate the size of attribute differences. As a consequence, the shift from a number to zero can make an advantage (or disadvantage) that seemed large and clear in the presence of a reference point become less clear and thus less impactful when a reference point is removed. This leads to an interesting effect, whereby an option can improve its choice share by increasing the level of an undesirable attribute from zero or decreasing the level of a desirable attribute to zero.

on scales with a higher number of units; expressing quality information on such

an expanded scale makes consumers switch to a higher-quality option. Testifying

to its practical importance, expressing the energy content of snacks in kilojoules

rather than kilocalories increases the choice of a healthy snack. The unit effect

occurs because consumers focus on the number rather than the type of units in

which information is expressed (numerosity effect). Therefore, reminding consumers

of alternative units in which information can be expressed eliminates the unit

effect. Finally, the unit effect moderates relative thinking: consumers are more

sensitive to relative attribute differences when the attribute is expressed on expanded

scales. The relation with anchoring and implications for temporal discounting

and loyalty programs are discussed.},

We find, in an experiment where we manipulate involvement, that when a haptic element is present, high autotelics are more persuaded regardless of their involvement with the message. However, for low autotelics, a haptic element increases persuasion under conditions of low versus high involvement with the message. A second experiment measures involvement and finds that again, under low involvement conditions, both high and low autotelics are persuaded by a touch element. Finally, a field study with a local symphony orchestra is conducted in which involvement with the message is low but involvement with the company is high. In this case, a touch element is only persuasive for high autotelics.},

@article{Rooderkerk.2011,
 abstract = {The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly

driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the

compromise, attraction, and similarity effect. As these context effects affect choices in a

systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model.

However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing

a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility

and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results

on choice-based conjoint data concerning digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence

for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the

behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in- and

out-of-sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the

authors illustrate how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more

profitable product lines.},

 abstract = {Null-hypothesis significance tests (NHSTs) have received much criticism, especially during the last two decades. Yet many behavioral and social scientists are unaware that NHSTs have drawn increasing criticism, so this essay summarizes key criticisms. The essay also recommends alternative ways of assessing research findings. Although these recommendations are not complex, they do involve ways of thinking that many behavioral and social scientists find novel. Instead of making NHSTs, researchers should adapt their research assessments to specific contexts and specific research goals, and then explain their rationales for selecting assessment indicators. Researchers should show the substantive importance of findings by reporting effect sizes and should acknowledge uncertainty by stating confidence intervals. By comparing data with na{\"i}ve hypotheses rather than with null hypotheses, researchers can challenge themselves to develop better theories. Parsimonious models are easier to understand, and they generalize more reliably. Robust statistical methods tolerate deviations from assumptions about samples},

 abstract = {Despite evidence that individual differences in numeracy affect judgment and decision making, the precise mechanisms underlying how such differences produce biases and fallacies remain unclear. Numeracy scales have been developed without sufficient theoretical grounding, and their relation to other cognitive tasks that assess numerical reasoning, such as the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), has been debated. In studies conducted in Brazil and in the USA, we administered an objective Numeracy Scale (NS), Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS), and the CRT to assess whether they measured similar constructs. The Rational--Experiential Inventory, inhibition (go/no-go task), and intelligence were also investigated. By examining factor solutions along with frequent errors for questions that loaded on each factor, we characterized different types of processing captured by different items on these scales. We also tested the predictive power of these factors to account for biases and fallacies in probability judgments. In the first study, 259 Brazilian undergraduates were tested on the conjunction and disjunction fallacies. In the second study, 190 American undergraduates responded to a ratio-bias task. Across the different samples, the results were remarkably similar. The results indicated that the CRT is not just another numeracy scale, that objective and subjective numeracy scales do not measure an identical construct, and that different aspects of numeracy predict different biases and fallacies. Dimensions of numeracy included computational skills such as multiplying, proportional reasoning, mindless or verbatim matching, metacognitive monitoring, and understanding the gist of relative magnitude, consistent with dual-process theories such as fuzzy-trace theory.},

Either mood congruence or mood regulation theories serve to explain these effects, though the latter theory is perhaps more sophisticated. This research goes a step further: in a sequence of four studies, the authors consider different products (with and without mood-lifting capabilities) and consumers' beliefs in the transience of their mood to illuminate the interplay between the two theoretical approaches. Culture (individualism vs. collectivism) emerges as an important driver of mood transience. Mood transience drives the likelihood of mood regulation through the consumption of products with mood-lifting capabilities. Willingness to pay serves as the dependent variable, in contrast with mood research that has focused almost entirely on nonmonetary forms of consumer behavior. Greater willingness to pay variance in bad moods, compared with good moods, offers evidence of the opposing effects of mood congruence and regulation.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physician rating websites (PRWs) are gaining in popularity among patients seeking quality information about physicians. However, little knowledge is available about the quantity and type of information provided on the websites. OBJECTIVE: To determine and structure the quantity and type of information about physicians in the outpatient sector provided on German-language physician rating websites. METHODS: In a first step, we identified PRWs through a systematic internet search using German keywords from a patient s perspective in the two search engines Google and Yahoo. Afterwards, information about physicians available on the websites was collected and categorised according to Donabedian s structure/process/outcome model. Furthermore, we investigated whether the information was related to the physician himself/ herself or to the practice as a whole. RESULTS: In total, eight PRWs were detected. Our analysis turned up 139 different information items on eight websites; 67 are related to the structural quality, 4 to process quality, 5 to outcomes, and 63 to patient satisfaction/experience. In total, 37{\%} of all items focus specifically on the physician and 63{\%} on the physician's practice. In terms of the total amount of information provided on the PRWs, results range from 61 down to 13.5 items. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of information is available on German PRWs. While structural information can give a detailed overview of the financial, technical and human resources of a practice, other outcome measures have to be interpreted with caution. Specifically, patient satisfaction results are not risk-adjusted, and thus, are not appropriate to represent a provider's quality of care. Consequently, neither patients nor physicians should yet use the information provided to make their final decision for or against an individual physician.},

To further assess the strength of the connection between embodied states and morality, we investigated whether the directionality of the effect could be reversed by exposing participants to different types of moral events prior to rating the same neutral tasting beverage. As expected, reading about moral transgressions, moral virtues, or control events resulted in inducing gustatory disgust, delight, or neutral taste experiences, respectively. Results are discussed in terms of the relation between embodied cognition and processing abstract conceptual representations.},

This is equivalent to increasing teacher quality by more than one standard deviation. A second treatment arm, identical to the loss aversion treatment but implemented in the standard fashion, yields smaller and statistically insignificant results. This suggests it is loss aversion, rather than other features of the design or population sampled, that leads to the stark differences between our findings and past research.},

 abstract = {Another person's caress is one of the most powerful of all emotional social signals. How much the primary somatosensory cortices (SIs) participate in processing the pleasantness of such social touch remains unclear. Although ample empirical evidence supports the role of the insula in affective processing of touch, here we argue that SI might be more involved in affective processing than previously thought by showing that the response in SI to a sensual caress is modified by the perceived sex of the caresser. In a functional MRI study, we manipulated the perceived affective quality of a caress independently of the sensory properties at the skin: heterosexual males believed they were sensually caressed by either a man or woman, although the caress was in fact invariantly delivered by a female blind to condition type. Independent analyses showed that SI encoded, and was modulated by, the visual sex of the caress, and that this effect is unlikely to originate from the insula. This suggests that current models may underestimate the role played by SI in the affective processing of social touch.},

Interestingly, relatively little attention has been paid to assessing the use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in marketing research---despite its increasing popularity in recent years. To fill this gap, we conducted an extensive search in the 30 top ranked marketing journals that allowed us to identify 204 PLS-SEM applications published in a 30-year period (1981 to 2010). A critical analysis of these articles addresses, amongst others, the following key methodological issues: reasons for using PLS-SEM, data and model characteristics, outer and inner model evaluations, and reporting. We also give an overview of the interdependencies between researchers' choices, identify potential problem areas, and discuss their implications. On the basis of our findings, we provide comprehensive guidelines to aid researchers in avoiding common pitfalls in PLS-SEM use. This study is important for researchers and practitioners, as PLS-SEM requires several critical choices that, if not made correctly, can lead to improper findings, interpretations, and conclusions.},

 abstract = {1. The use of both linear and generalized linearmixed-effectsmodels (LMMsandGLMMs) has become popular

not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution.

Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented asmodel comparison

tools formixed-effectsmodels.

2. The presentation of `variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic ofmixed-effectsmodels, however,

is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models

(GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model,

which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance

explained,R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest.

3. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 formixed-effectsmodels lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a

number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased

or negativeR2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation).

4. Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common

definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2

for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2

(marginal and conditional R2) for bothLMMs andGLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems.

5. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research,

regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to

facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

In three experimental studies of self-production involving a branded input product, the authors show that consumers' active engagement in the value creation process (preparing a meal) positively biases their evaluations of an outcome (a dish) and an input product (a dinner kit). A positive evaluation bias for the input product occurs despite increased self-attribution due to self-production. In support of an associative self-anchoring explanation and the notion of self-generated validity, self-producing consumers bias their sensory perceptions (e.g., perceived level of saltiness and spiciness) so that they match a positive evaluation of the outcome. Mediation analyses show that perceived self-integration (perceived link between self and outcome) partly mediates the positive effect of self-production on outcome evaluation. The authors conclude that branded input products may benefit from the evaluation bias caused by self-production.},

 abstract = {When decision-makers are faced with a choice among multiple options that have several attributes, preferences are often influenced by how the options are related to one another. For example, consumer preferences can be influenced, and even reversed, by the context defined by available products. This article discusses three standard context effects found in the preferential-choice literature: the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects. While decision theorists have attempted to explain these three effects under single modeling accounts, it has never before been demonstrated that these effects can be obtained within the same experimental paradigm. A set of experiments is described that demonstrate the three effects in an inference task. The paradigm is completely novel, as no previous experimental work has examined the standard context effects in inference. The experiments also add to evidence that the effects are not confined to choices among options with affective value, such as consumer products. The experimental results provide evidence that these effects might be a general property of human choice behavior and bring into question explanations of the effects that are based on the concept of loss-aversion asymmetry.},

@article{MarangvandeMheen.NovemberDecember2011,
 abstract = {Objective: To assess the impact of quality of care and other hospital information on patients' choices between hospitals. Methods: 665 former surgical patients were invited to respond to an Internet-based questionnaire including a choice-based conjoint analysis. Each patient was presented with 12 different comparisons of 2 hospitals, with each hospital characterized by 6 attributes containing 2 levels. Hospital attributes were included if frequently reported by patients as most important for future hospital choices. These included both general hospital information (e.g., atmosphere), information on quality of care (e.g., percentage of patients with ``textbook outcome''), and surgery-specific information (e.g., possibility for minimally invasive procedure). Hierarchial Bayes estimation was used to estimate the utilities for each attribute level for each patient. Based on the ranges of these utilities, the relative importance of each hospital attribute was determined for each participant as a measure of the impact on patients' choices. Results: 308 (46.3{\%}) questionnaires were available for analysis. Of the hospital attributes that patients considered, surgery-specific information on average had the highest relative importance (25.7 [23.9--27.5]), regardless of gender, age, and education. Waiting time and hospital atmosphere were considered least important. The attribute concerning the percentage of patients with ``textbook outcomes'' had the second greatest impact (18.3 [16.9--19.6]), which was similar for patients with different adverse outcome experience. Conclusions: Surgery-specific and quality of care information are more important than general information when patients choose between hospitals.},

@article{Adams.2011,
 abstract = {In countries where the notion of {\textquotedbl}reflexive patients{\textquotedbl} dominates the health policy landscape, patients are increasingly encouraged to publicize their personal experiences with health services provision by reviewing hospitals and professionals on the web. The number of websites where patients can review one or more aspects of their care (and read reviews posted by others) is growing. These sites are an example of the practice of crowdsourcing, where applications that facilitate user-generated content solicit feedback from a given public; site administrators then use this feedback for product development, quality improvement and policy change. The research presented here examines such developments in the context of ongoing discussions about reflexive consumerism and increased transparency in healthcare. It draws on data from a three-year study of share-your-experience sites in the U.S., U.K., and The Netherlands. Data is taken primarily from a discourse analysis of four of the six sites under study, including patient reviews of institutions and professionals (n=450). Supplementary data from interviews with stakeholders related to the Dutch sites (n=15) is also used. This is the first known study of multiple share-your-experience websites in different countries. It shows that monitoring as {\textquotedbl}reflexive{\textquotedbl} behavior is not automatic, but is encouraged by website creators who, hoping to use the posts for other purposes, act as mediators between patients and other healthcare stakeholders. It further argues that patients demonstrate more reflexivity than some stakeholders realize, although not necessarily in the way that Giddens proposed. It concludes with the argument that the focus on reflexivity in healthcare means that not only institutions must be more transparent about their performance; patients are expected to be more transparent about their choices, as well.},

@article{Paulsen.2012,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The clinical and scientific usage of patient-reported outcome measures is increasing in the health services. Often paper forms are used. Manual double entry of data is defined as the definitive gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format, but the process is laborious. Automated forms processing may be an alternative, but further validation is warranted.

METHODS

200 patients were randomly selected from a cohort of 5777 patients who had previously answered two different questionnaires. The questionnaires were scanned using an automated forms processing technique, as well as processed by single and double manual data entry, using the EpiData Entry data entry program. The main outcome measure was the proportion of correctly entered numbers at question, form and study level.

RESULTS

Manual double-key data entry (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0.046 (95{\%} CI: 0.001-0.258)) performed better than single-key data entry (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0.370 (95{\%} CI: 0.160-0.729), (p = 0.020)). There was no statistical difference between Optical Mark Recognition (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0.046 (95{\%} CI: 0.001-0.258)) and double-key data entry (p = 1.000). With the Intelligent Character Recognition method, there was no statistical difference compared to single-key data entry (error proportion per 1000 fields = 6.734 (95{\%} CI: 0.817-24.113), (p = 0.656)), as well as double-key data entry (error proportion per 1000 fields = 3.367 (95{\%} CI: 0.085-18.616)), (p = 0.319)).

CONCLUSIONS

Automated forms processing is a valid alternative to double manual data entry for highly structured forms containing only check boxes, numerical codes and no dates. Automated forms processing can be superior to single manual data entry through a data entry program, depending on the method chosen.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing cost pressure and changing patients' needs in the healthcare sector have led to new delivery models for primary care. Researchers and practitioners need to establish innovative methods to obtain insights into patients' preferences and effectiveness of healthcare services. AIM: This study reveals the crucial decision criteria of patients in choosing out-of-hours services and provides a projection of a future market share of the newly established central out-of-hours service, called General Practitioner Cooperative. DESIGN: A computer-aided discrete choice experiment. METHOD: Respondents were 350 patients in a European city who decided for a service when confronted with a medical emergency in an out-of-hours case; two scenarios called 'adult' and 'child', describing the persons requiring medical assistance, were used to increase generalizability. RESULTS: The two most important attributes were 'explanation by the doctor' and 'waiting time' while the others - 'availability of technical equipment', 'ease of access', 'type of consultation' and 'payment method' - were of less importance. The market share projections predict that the new General Practitioner Cooperative will capture about one third of the market ('adult': 39.1{\%}, 'child': 31.3{\%}), ahead of the emergency department, the second most preferred service ('adult': 32.7{\%}, 'child': 30.7{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the adoption of a new medical service. As a result, it extends current research approaches on eliciting and matching patient's needs and assists policy makers in establishing adequate service capacities.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE

To describe the adverse effects associated with energy drink consumption among adolescents and young adults.

DATA SOURCES

Review of literature utilizing Medscape, the Internet, MD Consult, and CINAHL. The following search terms were used: Energy drinks, caffeine, guarana, taurine, ginseng, sugar, and caffeine toxicity. Search was limited to English language sources from 2005 to 2010.

CONCLUSIONS

The popularity of energy drinks and the rapid growth of their excessive consumption among adolescents and young adults have brought about great concern in regards to overall health and well-being. Caffeine, which is readily available to minors, is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world and imposes a potentially harmful influence on health, academic performance, and personal adjustments. Teens and young adults account for nearly {\$}2.3 billion of energy drink sales. Adolescents and young adults are often unaware that various products, such as energy drinks, herbal medications, and various other medications that promote alertness, contain caffeine. When these products are taken together, caffeine toxicity and severe adverse effects can occur.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE

Practitioners need to be aware of the consequences of energy drink consumption and be prepared to provide appropriate patient education.},

Across two studies, we tested whether leading a participant to believe that other people do not like a food affects food liking evaluations. In Study 1, we exposed participants to social normative information suggesting a) that an in-group disliked orange juice, b) that an out-group disliked orange juice or c) that an in-group were neutral about orange juice. We then examined how much participants believed they liked orange juice. In Study 2, participants consumed a snack food before being led to believe that two previous participants had also eaten the food and either disliked or quite liked it. We asked participants to rate how much they had enjoyed eating the snack food. Across both studies, social influence was observed, as underlined by decreases in liking evaluations. In Study 1, beliefs about liking were only influenced by social normative information when the norm was expressed by an in-group. In Study 2, exposure to others' accounts of a negative experience with a food decreased evaluated liking of the recent consumption experience. These results suggest that social influence can act upon food liking evaluations.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of lavender olfactory stimulation intervention on fall incidence in elderly nursing home residents. DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Three randomly selected nursing homes in northern Japan. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-five nursing home residents aged 65 and older. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to the lavender (n = 73) or placebo group (n = 72) for a 360-day study period. The lavender group received continuous olfactory stimulation from a lavender patch. The placebo group received an unscented patch. MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome measure was resident falls. Other measurements taken at baseline and 12 months included functional ability (assessed using the Barthel Index), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)), and behavioral and psychological problems associated with dementia (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)). RESULTS: There were fewer fallers in the lavender group (n = 26) than in the placebo group (n = 36) (hazard ratio (HR)=0.57, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 0.34-0.95) and a lower incidence rate in the lavender group (1.04 per person-year) than in the placebo group (1.40 per person-year) (incidence rate ratio = 0.51, 95{\%} CI = 0.30-0.88). The lavender group also had a significant decrease in CMAI score (P = .04) from baseline to follow-up in a per protocol analysis. CONCLUSION: Lavender olfactory stimulation may reduce falls and agitation in elderly nursing home residents; further research is necessary to confirm these findings.},

 abstract = {Dual system and dual process views of the human

mind have contrasted automatic, fast, and non-conscious

with controlled, slow, and conscious thinking. This paper

integrates duality models from the perspective of consumer

psychology by identifying three relevant theoretical strands:

Persuasion and attitude change (e.g. Elaboration Likelihood

Model), judgment and decision making (e.g. Intuitive vs.

Reflective Model), as well as buying and consumption

behavior (e.g. Reflective-Impulsive Model). Covering different

aspects of consumer decision making, we discuss the

conditions under which different types of processes are

evoked, how they interact and how they apply to consumers'

processing of marketing messages, the evaluation of

product-related information, and purchasing behavior. We

further compare and contrast theoretical strands and incorporate

them with the literature on attitudes, showing how

duality models can help us understand implicit and explicit

attitude formation in consumer psychology. Finally, we offer

future research implications for scholars in consumer psychology

and marketing.},

@article{Stekhoven.2012,
 abstract = {MOTIVATION

Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.

RESULTS

We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10{\%} to 30{\%}. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.

AVAILABILITY

The package missForest is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/.

@article{Adan.2010,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To study the effects of consuming caffeine and glucose, alone and combined, on cognitive performance.

METHODS

Seventy-two healthy subjects (36 women; age range 18-25) were tested early in the morning, having fasted overnight. Using a double-blind, randomised design, subjects received one of the following beverages: water (150 ml); water plus 75 mg of caffeine; water plus 75 g of glucose; water plus and 75 mg of caffeine and 75 g of glucose. Attention, manual dexterity, visuo-spatial and frontal functions, memory (immediate, consolidation and working) and subjective state were all assessed.

RESULTS

The combination of caffeine and glucose had beneficial effects on attention (sequential reaction time tasks) and on learning and consolidation of verbal memory, effects not being observed when either substance was administered alone. Caffeine only showed improvement in simple reaction time and glucose in simple and one sequential reaction time tasks and in the manual dexterity assembly task.

CONCLUSIONS

The results indicate that the synergistic effects of caffeine and glucose can benefit sustained attention and verbal memory, even with adequate levels of activation of the subjects. However, further studies are required, controlling for different levels of cognitive effort and also considering measurements of neural activity.},

Fashion change agents and females had a greater NFT---total, autotelic and instrumental---than fashion followers and males. Fashion change agents and females scored equally high on autotelic and instrumental dimensions of NFT but fashion followers and males scored higher on the instrumental than the autotelic dimension.

An analysis of 30 years (1978--2007) of publishing data from major marketing journals indicates that conceptual articles are declining, despite repeated calls for more emphasis on this form of scholarship. The sharpest decline has occurred in Journal of Marketing (JM), with much of the shift occurring over the past decade. Many substantive areas remain largely unexplored in conceptual articles. Over this 30-year period, conceptual articles published in JM have disproportionately more citations relative to their numbers, attesting to the importance of their role in knowledge development. Addressing the decline of conceptual articles and restoring their synergistic balance with other forms of scholarship will require concerted efforts on several interrelated fronts: the current generation of scholars; doctoral programs and students; journals, reviewers, and review process; and promotion, tenure, and incentive systems},

@article{Schokker.2010,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether the impact of upward and downward social comparison information on individuals' motivation to manage their diabetes is dependent on their regulatory focus (promotion or prevention focus) and self-efficacy. DESIGN: The hypotheses were examined in a cross-sectional study. Patients with diabetes (N = 234) read a fictitious interview with a fellow patient, either an upward or a downward target, and they filled out questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motivation to work on diabetes regulation. RESULTS: High promotion-focused patients reported more motivation than low promotion-focused patients when confronted with the upward target (positive role model). High prevention-focused patients reported more motivation than low prevention-focused patients when confronted with the downward target (negative role model). This latter finding was qualified by patients' self-efficacy, as it applied only to patients with relatively high levels of self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The current study highlights the importance of considering individual differences when using role models to encourage self-care activities in persons with diabetes.},

@article{Scholer.2010,
 abstract = {Four studies demonstrate the importance of self-regulatory mechanisms for understanding risk-seeking behavior under loss. Findings suggest that risk seeking becomes a motivational necessity under 3 conditions: (a) when an individual is in a state of loss; (b) when the individual is in a prevention-focused regulatory state (E. T. Higgins, 1997); and (c) when the risky option alone offers the possibility of eliminating loss. In situations involving loss, prevention motivation but not promotion motivation (whether measured or manipulated) was uniquely associated with behaviors that served the motivation to maintain the status quo. When the risky option offered the sole possibility of returning to the status quo, prevention motivation predicted increased risk seeking. However, when a more conservative option was available that also offered the possibility to return to the status quo, prevention motivation predicted risk aversion. When neither option offered the possibility to return to the status quo, prevention motivation was not associated with risky choice. The authors discuss the benefits of complementing existing accounts of risky decision making under loss with regulatory focus motivational mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Crossmodal linkage between the olfactory and visual senses is still largely underexplored. In this study, we investigated crossmodal olfactory-visual associations by testing whether and how visual processing of objects is affected by the presence of olfactory cues. To this end, we explored the influence of prior learned associations between an odour (eg odour of orange) and a visual stimulus naturally associated with that odour (picture of orange) on the movements of the eyes over a complex scene. Participants were asked to freely explore a photograph containing an odour-related visual cue embedded among other objects while being exposed to the corresponding odour (subjects were unaware of the presence of the odour). Eye movements were recorded to analyse the order and distribution of fixations on each object of the scene. Our data show that the odour-related visual cue was explored faster and for a shorter time in the presence of the congruent odour. These findings suggest that odours can affect visual processing by attracting attention to the possible odour source and by facilitating its identification.},

@article{Sela.2010,
 abstract = {Paradoxically, although humans have a superb sense of smell, they don't trust their nose. Furthermore, although human odorant detection thresholds are very low, only unusually high odorant concentrations spontaneously shift our attention to olfaction. Here we suggest that this lack of olfactory awareness reflects the nature of olfactory attention that is shaped by the spatial and temporal envelopes of olfaction. Regarding the spatial envelope, selective attention is allocated in space. Humans direct an attentional spotlight within spatial coordinates in both vision and audition. Human olfactory spatial abilities are minimal. Thus, with no olfactory space, there is no arena for olfactory selective attention. Regarding the temporal envelope, whereas vision and audition consist of nearly continuous input, olfactory input is discreet, made of sniffs widely separated in time. If similar temporal breaks are artificially introduced to vision and audition, they induce ``change blindness'', a loss of attentional capture that results in a lack of awareness to change. Whereas ``change blindness'' is an aberration of vision and audition, the long inter-sniff-interval renders ``change anosmia'' the norm in human olfaction. Therefore, attentional capture in olfaction is minimal, as is human olfactory awareness. All this, however, does not diminish the role of olfaction through sub-attentive mechanisms allowing subliminal smells a profound influence on human behavior and perception.},

@article{Harrison.2009,
 abstract = {Randomization to treatment is fundamental to statistical control in the

design of experiments. But randomization implies some uncertainty about treatment

condition, and individuals differ in their preferences towards taking on risk. Since

human subjects often volunteer for experiments, or are allowed to drop out of the

experiment at any time if they want to, it is possible that the sample observed in an

experiment might be biased because of the risk of randomization. On the other

hand, the widespread use of a guaranteed show-up fee that is non-stochastic may

generate sample selection biases of the opposite direction, encouraging more risk

averse samples into experiments. We undertake a field experiment to directly test

these hypotheses that risk attitudes play a role in sample selection. We follow

standard procedures in the social sciences to recruit subjects to an experiment in

which we measure their attitudes to risk. We exploit the fact that we know certain

characteristics of the population sampled, adults in Denmark, allowing a statistical

correction for sample selection bias using standard methods. We also utilize the fact

that we have a complex sampling design to provide better estimates of the target

population. Our results suggest that randomization bias does affect the overall level

of risk aversion in the sample we observe, but that it does not affect the

demographic mix of risk attitudes in the sample. In complementary laboratory

experiments we find additional evidence that the common use of non-stochastic

show-up fees generates samples that are more risk averse than would otherwise have

been observed.},

@article{Herrmann.2009,
 abstract = {In recent years, many companies have considerably increased their

number of offering varieties. The underlying rationale for such

product strategies is substantiated by the belief that assortment

proliferation would better satisfy customers' diverse preferences.

However, empirical evidence exists suggesting that if there are too

many varieties to choose from, customers sometimes either refrain

from making a purchase at all, or else resort to simple selection

heuristics. This article approaches the issue of assortment variety

from a decision-theoretical perspective, by positing circumstances

under which expanding the number of varieties will positively or

negatively affect consumer behavior. Herein, the concept of attribute

alignability provides explanatory potential. Two experimental

studies are presented which analyze the effect of the number of

product varieties on customers' decision-making behavior by means

of manipulating the choice settings in a virtual car configurator. It

can be shown that whether the product attributes in question are

alignable or nonalignable is the decisive factor in explaining

customer decision making under variety. Furthermore, ``pseudoalignability''

is achieved easily via the relabeling of product options.

These findings yield concrete managerial insights for the customeroriented

design of product lines consisting of a basic product and

several varieties derived from it.},

 abstract = {Scholarship in marketing journals serves a critically important role in developing the

knowledge base of marketing. Knowledge contributions lead to advancements in the marketing

field as well as to individual recognitions such as promotions, merit increases, and various

accolades. In this study of 629 faculty members from a sampling frame of the worldwide

marketing professorate, we develop a relative hierarchical positioning of marketing journals using

the Popularity/Familiarity and Importance/Prestige Indices. Rankings are presented for the overall

sample along with the results of ten segmented analyses involving faculty rank, geographic

location of schools, and substantive subareas within marketing. To better understand the maturity

and complexity of the field, a trend analysis using 1987, 1997, and 2007 data is also conducted,

and comparisons to ranking studies using different methodologies are summarized. Broadly, the

results indicate that JM, JMR, and JCR maintain their top three rankings from 1987 and 1997 also

in 2007, and that the Journal of Service Research and Quantitative Marketing and Economics are

strong new entries in the rankings. Overall, the paper significantly extends previous knowledge by

providing an intertemporal analysis, conducting new segmentation analyses of the faculty

perceptions, and triangulating the results with those of prior studies using alternative methods.},

 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Holding warm feelings toward someone{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}giving someone the cold shoulder{\textquotedbl} indicate different levels of social proximity. In this article, we show effects of temperature that go beyond these metaphors people live by. In three experiments, warmer conditions, compared with colder conditions, induced (a) greater social proximity, (b) use of more concrete language, and (c) a more relational focus. Different temperature conditions were created by either handing participants warm or cold beverages (Experiment 1) or placing them in comfortable warm or cold ambient conditions (Experiments 2 and 3). These studies corroborate recent findings in the field of grounded cognition revealing that concrete experiences ground abstract concepts with which they are coexperienced. Our studies show a systemic interdependence among language, perception, and social proximity: Environmentally induced conditions shape not only language use, but also the perception and construal of social relationships.},

The authors provide evidence that EC can occur through an implicit misattribution mechanism in which an evaluative response evoked by a valenced stimulus is incorrectly and implicitly attributed to another stimulus, forming or changing an attitude toward this other stimulus. In 5 studies, the authors measured or manipulated variables related to the potential for the misattribution of an evaluation, or source confusability. Greater EC was observed when participants' eye gaze shifted frequently between a valenced and a neutral stimulus (Studies 1 {\&} 2), when the 2 stimuli appeared in close spatial proximity (Study 3), and when the neutral stimulus was made more perceptually salient than was the valenced stimulus, due to the larger size of the neutral stimulus (Study 4). In other words, conditions conducive to source confusability increased EC. Study 5 provided evidence for multiple mechanisms of EC by comparing the effects of mildly evocative valenced stimuli (those evoking responses that might more easily be misattributed to another object) with more strongly evocative stimuli.},

 abstract = {Compulsive buying (CB) has only relatively recently become a topic of interest for researchers and clinicians alike. This hiatus means that (unlike other impulse control disorders) there is currently little theoretical guidance for clinicians attempting to intervene with CB clients and no established model for researchers to evaluate, distil and refine. The current paper summarizes and organizes the main extant identified factors in the CB literature into four distinct phases: (1) antecedents; (2) internal/external triggers; (3) the act of buying; and finally, (4) post-purchase. The relationships and interactions between the identified phases are then hypothesized, within the proposed cognitive-behavioural model. The model distinguishes the key cognitive, affective and behavioural factors within each phase and identifies how CB can become self-reinforcing over time. The over-arching treatment implication is that CB can be re-conceptualized as chronic and repetitive failure in self-regulation efforts, and that psychological interventions can accommodate this in attempting to facilitate change. A successful case example is provided of a 'co-dependent compulsive buyer' using the model, with psychometric evaluation of key aspects of CB and mental health at assessment, termination and 6-month follow-up. The research and clinical implications of the proposed model are discussed, alongside identified short-comings and the need for psychological services to respond appropriately to CB clients seeking help.},

In Study 1, a list of terms selected for their relevance to describe affective feelings induced by odors was assessed while participants were exposed to a set of odorant samples. The data were submitted to a series of exploratory factor analyses to 1) reduce the set of variables to a smaller set of summary scales and 2) get a preliminary sense of the differentiation of affective feelings elicited by odors. The goal of Study 2 was to replicate the findings of Study 1 with a larger sample of odorant samples and participants and to validate the preliminary model obtained in Study 1 by using confirmatory factor analysis. Overall, the findings point to a structure of affective responses to odors that differs from the classical taxonomies of emotion such as posited by discrete or bidimensional emotion theories. These findings suggest that the subjective affective experiences or feelings induced by odors are structured around a small group of dimensions that reflect the role of olfaction in well-being, social interaction, danger prevention, arousal or relaxation sensations, and conscious recollection of emotional memories.},

Barter conjoint collects a substantially larger amount of data compared to CBC and allows for information diffusion among respondents. We conducted two empirical studies that compare CBC (with and without incentive alignment) and barter conjoint. The studies employed a total of three product categories, each with two validation tasks (one follows immediately and one conducted two weeks later). Our results confirmed prior research that incentive alignment, in general, substantially improves out-of-sample predictive performance of CBC. Furthermore, we found barter conjoint performs substantially better than the incentive-aligned CBC. However, in the spirit of ``no free lunch,'' barter conjoint is more taxing (in various ways) than CBC, suggesting a potential trade-off between consumer resource allocation (at the time of the task) and (managerial) predictive accuracy downstream. Given that this is the first study on barter conjoint, we discuss various limitations of the current implementation and fruitful directions for future research.},

The results of PA were found not to vary by distributional assumption.

when consumers will settle for shortcut solutions to choice problems (e.g., compromise)

propose that both motivation to use self-goals, as indexed by need for cognition

(NFC), and cognitive ability, manipulated through cognitive load, influence the use

of the compromise heuristic. Three studies showed that NFC is associated with

less compromise at baseline but not under load. Process measures andmoderation

tests suggest that load disrupts access to self-goals and that NFC relates to selfgoal

use. Thus, load differentially influences compromise choice across levels of

NFC.},

 abstract = {Research has shown that animals and humans habituate on a variety of behavioral and physiological responses to repeated presentations of food cues, and habituation is related to amount of food consumed and cessation of eating. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of experimental paradigms used to study habituation, integrate a theoretical approach to habituation to food based on memory and associative conditioning models, and review research on factors that influence habituation. Individual differences in habituation as they relate to obesity and eating disorders are reviewed, along with research on how individual differences in memory can influence habituation. Other associative conditioning approaches to ingestive behavior are reviewed, as well as how habituation provides novel approaches to preventing or treating obesity. Finally, new directions for habituation research are presented. Habituation provides a novel theoretical framework from which to understand factors that regulate ingestive behavior},

@article{Forman.2009,
 abstract = {Our paper shows that the parameters in existing theoretical models of channel substitution such as offline transportation cost, online disutility cost, and the prices of online and offline retailers interact to determine consumer choice of channels. In this way, our results provide empirical support for many such models. In particular, we empirically examine the trade-off between the benefits of buying online and the benefits of buying in a local retail store. How does a consumer's physical location shape the relative benefits of buying from the online world? We explore this problem using data from Amazon.com on the top-selling books for 1,497 unique locations in the United States for 10 months ending in January 2006. We show that when a store opens locally, people substitute away from online purchasing, even controlling for product-specific preferences by location. These estimates are economically large, suggesting that the disutility costs of purchasing online are substantial and that offline transportation costs matter. We also show that offline entry decreases consumers' sensitivity to online price discounts. However, we find no consistent evidence that the breadth of the product line at a local retail store affects purchases.},

subjects were asked to make a sequential purchase decision and were given the opportunity

to purchase information about the value of a good prior to a decision to purchase

the good itself. There, subjects purchased information less often than expected

which was interpreted as risk-seeking behavior. Here, we test a payment hypothesis

by varying the timing of the participation payment. Payment of a show-up fee before

the decision-making stages of the experiment increases information purchase, which

we interpret as an increase in risk-averse behavior.},

 abstract = {Whether neonatal odor memory can persist into toddlerhood and influence behaviors that tap processes related to cognition (attention and exploration), motivation (choice and consumption), and emotion (hedonic processing) remains under-researched. Using a quasi-experimental longitudinal design, we examined whether an odor experienced at the mother's breast can be retained at 7 and 21 months. The prescribed prophylactic use of a camomile-scented balm defined two groups: infants exposed (CaE) or never exposed (CaNE) to camomile odor. At 7 months, exploratory responses to three similar objects differing in odor (including camomile) were analyzed. At 21 months, three tasks were used to assess toddlers' (i) facial responses; (ii) exploratory responses to three similar, but differently odorized objects; and (iii) choices between two bottles carrying different odors. CaE infants displayed preferential responses for camomile odor at both ages in every task. In contrast, CaNE infants behaved either randomly or more negatively to camomile odor. This study indicates that early odor memories acquired during breastfeeding can be reactivated and influence behavioral processes until at least toddlerhood.},

This paper investigates whether there is a link between cognitive ability, risk aversion, and impatience, using a representative sample of the population and incentive compatible measures. We conduct choice experiments measuring risk aversion, and impatience over an annual time horizon, for a randomly drawn sample of roughly 1,000 German adults. Subjects also take part in two different tests of cognitive ability, which correspond to sub-modules of one of the most widely used IQ tests. Interviews are conducted in subjects' own homes. We find that lower cognitive ability is associated with greater risk aversion, and more pronounced impatience. These relationships are significant, and robust to controlling for personal characteristics, educational attainment, income, and measures of credit constraints. We perform a series of additional robustness checks, which help rule out other possible confounds.},

 abstract = {Conjoint analysis (CA) has emerged as an important approach to the assessment of health service preferences. This article examines Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (ACBC) and reviews available evidence comparing ACBC with conventional approaches to CA. ACBC surveys more closely approximate the decision-making processes that influence real-world choices. Informants begin ACBC surveys by completing a build-your-own (BYO) task identifying the level of each attribute that they prefer. The ACBC software composes a series of attribute combinations clustering around each participant's BYO choices. During the Screener section, informants decide whether each of these concepts is a possibility or not. Probe questions determine whether attribute levels consistently included in or excluded from each informant's Screener section choices reflect `Unacceptable' or `Must Have' simplifying heuristics. Finally, concepts identified as possibilities during the Screener section are carried forward to a Choice Tournament. The winning concept in each Choice Tournament set advances to the next choice set until a winner is determined.

A review of randomized trials and cross-over studies suggests that, although ACBC surveys require more time than conventional approaches to CA, informants find ACBC surveys more engaging. In most studies, ACBC surveys yield lower standard errors, improved prediction of hold-out task choices, and better estimates of real-world product decisions than conventional choice-based CA surveys.},

The handbook covers the broad area of PLS methods -from regression to structural equation modeling applications, software and interpretation of results. It features papers on the use and the analysis of latent variables and indicators by means of the PLS path modeling approach from the design of the causal network to model assessment and improvement. Within the PLS framework, the handbook also addresses advanced topics such as the analysis of multi-block, multi-group and multi-structured data, the use of categorical indicators, the study of interaction effects, the integration of classification issues, the validation aspects and the comparison between the PLS approach and covariance based structural equation modeling. Most chapters comprise a thorough discussion of applications to marketing and related areas, some tutorials focus on key aspects of PLS analysis with a didactic approach. This handbook serves both as an introduction for those without prior knowledge of PLS and as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners interested in the most recent advances in PLS methodology.

@article{Fenko.2010,
 abstract = {In the area of product design, sensory dominance can be defined as the relative importance of different sensory modalities for product experience. It is often assumed that vision dominates the other senses. In the present study, we asked 243 participants to describe their experiences with consumer products in various situations: while buying a product, after the first week, the first month, and the first year of usage. The data suggest that the dominant sensory modality depends on the period of product usage. At the moment of buying, vision is the most important modality, but during the usage the other sensory modalities gain importance. The roles of the different modalities during usage are product-dependent. Averaged over 93 products analyzed in this study, after one month of usage touch becomes more important than vision, and after one year vision, touch and audition appear to be equally important. We conclude that to create a long-lasting positive product experience, designers need to consider user-product interaction at different stages of product usage and to determine which sensory modality dominates product experience at each stage.},

Drawing on the context-effects literature, the authors postulate how the introduction of economy and premium PLs may affect the choice of mainstream-quality and premium-quality national brands (NBs) and the choice of the retailer's existing PL offering. The authors use the natural experiment offered by Asda's and Sainsbury's introduction of economy and premium PL tiers in the corn flakes and canned soup categories in the United Kingdom to test their framework. Using brand choice models that accommodate context (compromise, similarity, and attraction) effects, the authors find that both economy and premium PLs cannibalize incumbent PLs. Economy PL introductions benefit mainstream-quality NBs because these NBs become a compromise or middle option in terms of quality in the retailer's assortment. The effects of premium PL introductions on premium-quality NBs are mixed: Their share improves in two of four cases but decreases in the other two cases.},

First, the possibility that neuroimaging will become cheaper and faster than other marketing methods; and second, the hope that neuroimaging will provide marketers with information that is not obtainable through conventional marketing methods. Although neuroimaging is unlikely to be cheaper than other tools in the near future, there is growing evidence that it may provide hidden information about the consumer experience. The most promising application of neuroimaging methods to marketing may come before a product is even released --- when it is just an idea being developed.},

 abstract = {Eating is a multisensory experience involving more than simply the oral sensation of the taste and smell of foods. It has been shown that the way foods look, sound, and feel like in the mouth all affect food perception. The influence of haptic information available when handling food is relatively unknown. In this study, blindfolded participants bit-into fresh or stale pretzels while rating their freshness staleness and crispness-softness. Information provided to the hand was either congruent (whole pretzel fresh or stale) or incongruent (half pretzel fresh, half stale) with what was presented to the mouth. The results demonstrate that the perception of both freshness and crispness was systematically altered when incongruent information was provided: bit-into fresh pretzel tips were perceived as staler and softer when a stale pretzel tip was held in the hand and vice versa. Haptic information available when handling food thus plays a significant role in modulating food perception.},

 abstract = {The results of five experiments reveal that when sampling a series of experiential products (e.g., beverages, music), consumers prefer the product sampled second in a series of two desirable products but relatively prefer the product sampled first in a series of two undesirable products. The underlying process for both outcomes is a recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two desirable products). However, the preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product holds only if there is no time delay between the sampling of the products or between the sampling and the choice evaluations.},

@article{CampbellMeiklejohn.2010,
 abstract = {Continued gambling to recover lossesF`loss chasing'Fis a prominent feature of social and pathological gambling. However, little is

known about the neuromodulators that influence this behavior. In three separate experiments, we investigated the role of serotonin

activity, D2/D3 receptor activity, and beta-adrenoceptor activity on the loss chasing of age and IQ-matched healthy adults randomized to

treatment or an appropriate control/placebo. In Experiment 1, participants consumed amino-acid drinks that did or did not contain the

serotonin precursor, tryptophan. In Experiment 2, participants received a single 176 mg dose of the D2/D3 receptor agonist, pramipexole,

or placebo. In Experiment 3, participants received a single 80 mg dose of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, or placebo.

Following treatment, participants completed a computerized loss-chasing game. Mood and heart rate were measured at baseline and

following treatment. Tryptophan depletion significantly reduced the number of decisions made to chase losses, and the number of

consecutive decisions to chase, in the absence of marked changes in mood. By contrast, pramipexole significantly increased the value of

losses chased and diminished the value of losses surrendered. Propranolol markedly reduced heart rate, but produced no significant

changes in loss-chasing behavior. Loss chasing can be thought of as an aversively motivated escape behavior controlled, in part, by the

marginal value of continued gambling relative to the value of already accumulated losses. Serotonin and dopamine appear to play

dissociable roles in the tendency of individuals to gamble to recover, or to seek to `escape' from, previous losses. Serotonergic activity

seems to promote the availability of loss chasing as a behavioral option, whereas D2/D3 receptor activity produces complex changes in

the value of losses judged worth chasing. Sympathetic arousal, at least as mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, does not play a major role

in laboratory-based loss-chasing choices.

 abstract = {Today's ageing population is an ever-increasing, highly diverse group of people wanting to live a healthy and enjoyable life. Seniors increasingly see the importance of eating healthy and delicious food in a pleasant environment in achieving happiness and well-being. Up until now, the food industry has been rather slow in transforming the wealth of available knowledge regarding the nutritional needs and sensory perception of the ageing into new food products. Based on our own and the published research of others, we discuss here how the design of new meals for an ageing population can be tackled by a consumer-led approach to food product development. After a brief overview of the underlying concepts and practices, a detailed description is given of how this approach could be used in the design of Home Meal Replacements for senior households. This description includes also a comprehensive review of the major determinants of food preference and meal choice behavior in a later age. Finally, relevant implications are derived from the work presented and future trends in the technological development of foods for the ageing highlighted.},

In a typical SSS paradigm, the participants receive a range of food items to taste and evaluate and then one of the foods is consumed ad libitum until satiation. After the consumption of the test food, all the foods (including the test food) are then again tasted and evaluated. If SSS is the result of habituation this evaluation of the test food after its consumption would be subject to dishabituation (i.e. recovery of SSS) if the other unconsumed foods are evaluated first. To examine whether this is the case a total of 57 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Test Food First (TFF; n=28) or Test Food Last (TFL; n=29). We hypothesized that group TFF would show stronger SSS than TFL. We found clear indication of SSS, but the degree of SSS did not differ between the two groups (F[1,55]{\textless}1). This finding suggests that SSS is unaffected by the sequence of tasting food items with its assessment. The potential implications for understanding SSS in terms of habituation are discussed.},

Soft drinks are also a common source of caffeine as well as energy drinks, a category of functional beverages. Moderate caffeine consumption is considered safe and its use as a food ingredient has been approved, within certain limits, by numerous regulatory agencies around the world. Performance benefits attributed to caffeine include physical endurance, reduction of fatigue, and enhancing mental alertness and concentration. Caffeine has also been recently linked to weight loss and consequent reduction of the overall risks for developing the metabolic syndrome. However, the caloric contribution of caffeine-sweetened beverages needs to be considered in the overall energy balance.

In this article, the authors find that type of food consumed can also influence impulsive choice. Specifically, food that enhances the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin can reduce impulsive choice. To test the hypotheses on the influence of serotonin on postconsumption impulsive choice, the authors collected data on the eve of Thanksgiving. The occasion of Thanksgiving dinner provides a naturalistic setting in which people consume a tryptophan-rich meal (tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin). The authors replicate these findings and obtain converging evidence in a lab setting in which they give some participants a tryptophan-rich beverage and observe their postconsumption impulsive choices.},

Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.},

In a laboratory-based replication study, we tested CE both in hypothetical non-binding settings most commonly used in previous research on CE as well as in settings where experienced consumers make unforced and binding purchase decisions between real brands of two particular categories. While results prove robustness of the compromise effect even in the binding choice context, its magnitude is significantly reduced, hence indicating a hypothetical bias. Thus, since the CE is evidently less prevalent in the more realistic binding choice setting, compromise effects must be considered overrated to a certain degree in the previous studies on hypothetical decisions.},

 abstract = {Reviewers of research reports frequently criticize the choice of statistical methods. While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for {\textquotedbl}getting the wrong answer{\textquotedbl}.},

Across a total of 214 studies included in the main sample, the mean EC effect was d = .52, with a 95{\%} confidence interval of .466-.582. As estimated from a random-effects model, about 70{\%} of the variance in effect sizes were attributable to true systematic variation rather than sampling error. Moderator analyses were conducted to partially explain this variation, both as a function of concrete aspects of the procedural implementation and as a function of the abstract aspects of the relation between CS and US. Among a range of other findings, EC effects were stronger for high than for low contingency awareness, for supraliminal than for subliminal US presentation, for postacquisition than for postextinction effects, and for self-report than for implicit measures. These findings are discussed with regard to the procedural boundary conditions of EC and theoretical accounts about the mental processes underlying EC.},

Experts from around the world present changes in the global marketplace and developments in research methodologies underpinning new product development (NPD) in this essential collection. The business and marketing aspects of NPD, sometimes neglected in books of this type, are addressed alongside methods for product testing. Trends, processes and perspectives in consumer-driven NPD in the food and personal care product industries are addressed in the opening chapters of the book. Specific topics include evolution in food retailing and advances in concept research. Hedonic testing is the focus of the next section. Different viewpoints on consumer research methods and statistics for NPD are reviewed in later chapters. The final part of the book looks towards the future of innovation, covering the implications for NPD of topics such as human genetic variation in taste perception and neuroimaging. Several chapters are not standard scientific articles. Rather they are written records of conversations between two people on a particular topic related to consumer-driven innovation in foods and personal care products. In them the interviewees speak freely about their views and experiences in NPD, providing unique insights. Consumer-driven innovation in food and personal care products will broaden readers' understanding of the many approaches available to NPD personnel and ways in which they can be used to support innovation activities.

@article{Jamshidian.2010,
 abstract = {Test of homogeneity of covariances (or homoscedasticity) among several groups has many applications in statistical analysis. In the context of incomplete data analysis, tests of homoscedasticity among groups of cases with identical missing data patterns have been proposed to test whether data are missing completely at random (MCAR). These tests of MCAR require large sample sizes n and/or large group sample sizes n(i), and they usually fail when applied to non-normal data. Hawkins (1981) proposed a test of multivariate normality and homoscedasticity that is an exact test for complete data when n(i) are small. This paper proposes a modification of this test for complete data to improve its performance, and extends its application to test of homoscedasticity and MCAR when data are multivariate normal and incomplete. Moreover, it is shown that the statistic used in the Hawkins test in conjunction with a nonparametric k-sample test can be used to obtain a nonparametric test of homoscedasticity that works well for both normal and non-normal data. It is explained how a combination of the proposed normal-theory Hawkins test and the nonparametric test can be employed to test for homoscedasticity, MCAR, and multivariate normality. Simulation studies show that the newly proposed tests generally outperform their existing competitors in terms of Type I error rejection rates. Also, a power study of the proposed tests indicates good power. The proposed methods use appropriate missing data imputations to impute missing data. Methods of multiple imputation are described and one of the methods is employed to confirm the result of our single imputation methods. Examples are provided where multiple imputation enables one to identify a group or groups whose covariance matrices differ from the majority of other groups.},

This chapter focuses on the ``how'' question, that is, the question of what cognitive processes intervene between mere co-occurrence and attitude formation or change. Though EC has typically been thought of as occurring through a single, albeit contentious, mechanism, we begin by pointing out that both the heterogeneity of EC methodologies and the abundance of inconsistent results suggest that multiple processes with different characteristics can produce EC. We describe how the earliest posited process of EC, Pavlovian conditioning or signal learning, is a valid mechanism of EC that appears to have operated in some experiments but is unlikely to have operated in others and also cannot account for various EC findings. We describe other mechanisms of EC, when they can be expected to occur, and what characteristics they have. We particularly focus our attention on a process model of EC we have recently introduced, the implicit misattribution model. Finally, we describe the implications of a multi-process view of EC, which we argue can help resolve theoretical controversies and further the application of EC as a practical intervention for influencing attitudes in various domains.},

Journal of Sensory Studies, 16, 117--159] proposed the labeled magnitude (LAM) scale for measuring food acceptance. The LAM is a line scale anchored at its end points with the phrases ``greatest imaginable like'' and ``greatest imaginable dislike'' and uses as intermediate anchors the nine phrases of the traditional hedonic scale. In this study, three hedonic scales were compared, including the widely-used 9-point hedonic scale, the LAM scale, and an 11-point category scale using the LAM's verbal anchors as category labels. Three groups of consumers (N = about 100 each) used one of the three scales to evaluate the acceptability of highly liked foods (orange juices, potato chips, cookies, and ice cream, with four samples of each). Scales were evaluated primarily on their ability to show differences in acceptability, the correspondence of acceptance ratings to preference ranking and the correspondence of stated product usage (e.g., purchase of pulp vs. non-pulp orange juice) to the product scoring highest. All three scales performed equally well, with no one scale showing a consistent superiority over another. All three scales were able to differentiate acceptability of the orange juices, chips and cookies. No scale differentiated among the ice creams, which had equal and high acceptability. All scales showed a strong correspondence between liking and preference rankings and also between the product rated highest and the type of product usually consumed, within each of the product categories.},

that result in a pronounced tendency to make counternormative choices. We also

show that incompatibility with a product's attributes leads to choosing extreme alternatives,

which suggests the presence of a ``pick-your-poison'' effect. We test our

hypotheses using the attraction, compromise, and deferral paradigms. We close

by discussing our results in the context of the Lewinian view of decision conflict},

 abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this editorial is to bring together thoughts and opinions from the Editors

and Senior Advisory Board of EJM regarding the nature of the long-debated ``theory-practice divide''

in marketing scholarship.

Design/methodology/approach -- The authors synthesise diverse opinions from senior academics

in order both to inspire further debate in marketing scholarship, and to draw some important

conclusions for marketing academia as a whole.

Findings -- The authors propose that, for marketing scholarship to mature and progress, room must

be found for those who wish to focus both on practical and on pure marketing scholarship. Career

advancement from both routes is vital.

Research limitations/implications -- The topic of the theory-practice gap is complex. Many

diverse opinions are cited and, due to space constraints, the coverage of many issues is necessarily

brief.

Practical implications -- Scholars should find the thoughts contained in the paper of significant

interest.

Originality/value -- The paper appears to be the first to bring together such a set of diverse opinions

on the subject, and to try to draw some overall pragmatic conclusions, while still recognising the

multiplicity of valid thought in the area.},

@article{Crockett.2012,
 abstract = {Abstract

Rationale The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been

implicated in both aversive processing and impulsivity.

Reconciling these accounts, recent studies have demonstrated

that 5-HT is important for punishment-induced

behavioural inhibition. These studies focused on situations

where actions lead directly to punishments. However,

decision-making often involves making tradeoffs between

small `local' costs and larger `global' losses.

Objective We aimed to distinguish whether 5-HT promotes

avoidance of local losses, global losses, or both, in contrast

to an overall effect on reflection impulsivity. We further

examined the influence of individual differences in subclinical

depression, anxiety and impulsivity on global and

local loss avoidance.

Methods Healthy volunteers (N=21) underwent an acute

tryptophan depletion procedure in a double-blind, placebocontrolled

crossover design. We measured global and local

loss avoidance in a decision-making task where subjects

could sample information at a small cost to avoid making

incorrect decisions, which resulted in large losses.

Results Tryptophan depletion removed the suppressive

effects of small local costs on information sampling

behaviour. Sub-clinical depressive symptoms produced

effects on information sampling similar to (but independent

from) those of tryptophan depletion. Dispositional anxiety

was related to global loss avoidance. However, trait

impulsivity was unrelated to information sampling.

Conclusions The current findings are consistent with recent

theoretical work that characterises 5-HT as pruning a tree of

potential decisions, eliminating options expected to lead to

aversive outcomes. Our results extend this account by

proposing that 5-HT promotes reflexive avoidance of

relatively immediate aversive outcomes, potentially at the

expense of more globally construed future losses.

Those preparations have proved successful in replicating many Pavlovian phenomena. In the present paper we tested a novel associative learning preparation in which visually presented letters were paired with a visual outcome. Reaction times (RTs) were recorded to assess associative strength between specific cues and the outcome. Combining two different dependent variables (RTs and type of response given), we propose a rule for evaluating the associative strength between two events. The preparation and the data transformation rule were successful in producing several Pavlovian phenomena including excitatory acquisition, extinction, overshadowing, and latent inhibition, as well as established summation effects. Advantages and limitations of this new preparation based on the use of RT are discussed.},

We present selfsurvey.org, an online survey platform that allows providing instant and respondent-specific feedback based on a scientifically grounded research model and a structural equation model-based prediction technique. Based on the partial least squares analysis results of a training dataset, selfsurvey employs a scoring algorithm to derive respondent-specific predicted scores, compares these with the observed scores, and provides visualized and text-based outputs. Our evaluation of selfsurvey in the context of a maturity benchmarking study provides an indication for the perceived usefulness of this artifact and its underlying scoring algorithm. We argue that this prediction-based approach, which goes far beyond the functionality of common univariate benchmarking tools, can be used for a wide range of survey studies and help increase the perceived relevance of academic survey studies to practice.},

 abstract = {Mental imagery may occur in any sensory modality, although visual imagery has been most studied. A sensitive measure of the vividness of imagery across a range of modalities is needed: the shorter version of Bett's Questionnaire upon Mental Imagery (Sheehan, , J. Clin. Psychology, 23, 386) uses outdated items and has an unreliable factor structure. We report the development and initial validation of the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (Psi-Q) comprising items for each of the following modalities: Vision, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Bodily Sensation, and Emotional Feeling. An exploratory factor analysis on a 35-item form indicated that these modalities formed separate factors, rather than a single imagery factor, and this was replicated by confirmatory factor analysis. The Psi-Q was validated against the Spontaneous Use of Imagery Scale (Reisberg et al., , Appl. Cogn. Psychology, 17, 147) and Marks' (, J. Mental Imagery, 19, 153) Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VVIQ-2). A short 21-item form comprising the best three items from the seven factors correlated with the total score and subscales of the full form, and with the VVIQ-2. Inspection of the data shows that while visual and sound imagery is most often rated as vivid, individuals who rate one modality as strong and the other as weak are not uncommon. Findings are interpreted within a working memory framework and point to the need for further research to identify the specific cognitive processes underlying the vividness of imagery across sensory modalities.},

Three experiments are reported in which each type of processing was triggered in different conditions either via different payoff structures or different degrees of attribute knowledge. The effects of the 3 main independent variables (the size of the choice set, the utility of the best option, and the number of competitive options) differed depending on the payoff structure or attribute knowledge conditions in ways predicted by the 2S2T framework.

Using a within-subject experimental design, participants in 2 studies repeatedly choose among sets of options (consumer products) described on several attributes. The results of Study 1 showed that all models predicted participants' choices equally well. In Study 2, in which the choice sets were explicitly designed to distinguish the models, MDFT had an advantage in predicting the observed choices. Study 2 further revealed the occurrence of multiple context effects within single participants, indicating an interdependent evaluation of choice options and correlations between different context effects. In sum, the results indicate that sequential sampling models can provide relevant insights into the cognitive process underlying preferential choices and thus can lead to better choice predictions.},

As a result of this, their attention towards task-relevant cues is biased in favor of cues supporting available responses. Changing these responses can alter the cues used in the judgment task and, subsequently, alter beliefs. We use this mechanism to predict and explain the emergence of the asymmetric dominance effect in judgment. In four sets of experiments, we document systematic changes in belief, as dominated options are added to the response set. These effects emerge for a number of naturalistic judgment tasks and are mediated by the increased accessibility of decoy-supporting cues. Finally, these effects can be eliminated when the decision maker's attention is drawn towards the cues supporting the non-dominant response.},

 abstract = {Marketers are increasingly allowing consumers to sample sensory-rich experiential products before making purchase decisions. The results of seven experimental studies (two conducted in field settings, three conducted in a laboratory, and two conducted online) demonstrate that the order in which consumers sample products and the level of (dis)similarity between the sensory cues of the products influence choices. In the absence of any moderators, when sampling a sequence of sensory-rich experiential products (e.g., fragrances, chocolates, flavored beverages, music) with similar sensory cues (e.g., smell, taste, color, sound), consumers prefer the first product in the sequence. However, when sampling a sequence of products with dissimilar sensory cues, consumers prefer the last product. These findings (1) contribute to a better understanding of the role of sequential sensory cues on consumer choice formation, (2) have implications for effects related to sensory habituation and sensory trace fading, and (3) help resolve apparent inconsistencies in prior research on order effects in the context of choices for sequentially sampled experiential products.},

@article{Cardenas.2014,
 abstract = {The house-money effect, understood as people's tendency to be more daring with easily-gotten money, is a behavioral pattern that poses questions about the external validity of experiments in economics: to what extent do people behave in experiments like they would have in a real-life situation, given that they play with easily-gotten house money? We ran an economic experiment with 122 students to measure the house-money effect on their risk preferences. They received an amount of money with which they made risky decisions involving losses and gains; a randomly selected treatment group received the money 21 days in advance and a control group got it the day of the experiment. From a simple calculation we found that participants in the treatment group only spent on average approximately 35 {\%} of their cash in advance. The data confirms the well documented results that men are more tolerant to risk than women, and that individuals in general are more risk tolerant towards losses than towards gains. With our preferred specification, we find a mean CRRA risk aversion coefficient of 0.34, with a standard deviation of 0.09. Furthermore, if subjects in the treatment group spent 35 {\%} of the endowment their CRRA risk aversion coefficient is higher than that of the control group by approximately 0.3 standard deviations. We interpret this result as evidence of a small and indirect house money effect operating though the amount of the cash in advance that was actually spent. We conclude that the house money effect may play a small role in decisions under uncertainty, especially when involving losses. Our novel design, however, could be used for other domains of decision making both in the lab and for calibration of economic models used in micro and macroeconomics.},

While this effect is widely known and replicated, there is less clarity as to the mechanisms underlying the attraction effect. In this paper, we explore both the motivation (i.e. why people process choice information the way they do) and the choice processing strategy (i.e. how people process choice information) underpinning the phenomenon of attraction effect. Our results indicate that , in the case of promotion-focused individuals, the desire for a choice which can be easily justified (ease of justification) influences the attraction effect; whereas, for prevention-focused individuals, the desire for a choice that maximizes overall utility (overall attractiveness) influences the same effect. Furthermore, promotion-focused people rely on lexicographic processing strategy, whereas prevention-focused individuals use an equal weight processing strategy as means of demonstrating their motivations.},

@article{Wendin.2015,
 abstract = {The concept of Living Labs (LLs) has evolved to support the creation of experience-based development of innovations in real-life, user-driven and open environments. Two types of consumer product tests used generally are central location tests (CLT) and home use tests (HUT) where the acceptability or liking of a product or group of products is determined together with the view of whether one product is preferred over other products. This article explores the similarities and differences between CLT and HUT test results in a LL context. In both settings, the acceptance of five flavoured chocolate bars was evaluated for appearance, odour, taste/flavour, texture and overall liking. Apart from the mean values of liking in the two tests, data were analysed to identify consumer segments. Qualitative data were also collected by asking for consumer comments on the tested samples. The results show that independent of test method the bars were evaluated equally and all accepted by the consumers. A clear difference between CLT and HUT testing was that CLT consumers significantly differed from the HUT consumers, giving the test samples lower scores. For example, the mean values of the overall acceptance scores given by HUT consumers varied between 6.0 and 6.6, while for CLT consumers the corresponding values varied from 5.4 to 5.9. Another difference was the number of comments from consumers. CLT consumers richly commented on the products in a verbose way, while HUT consumers used the opportunity to comment very sparingly. Considering the cluster analysis as yet another difference between the testing methods, clusters from the CLT were more distinct and the number was higher with five clusters in CLT and four in HUT. Clusters where consumers liked all the products in both test settings were twice as many for HUT than in CLT. Applying the LL approach, there is a need for methods and approaches that capture a rich picture of consumers during test performance without being intrusive or obstructive of activities and context. The approach offers the opportunity for companies to have consumers not only test products but also offer input that can stimulate new innovations and give consumers more power and influence.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is increasing recognition that supermarkets are an important environment for health-promoting interventions such as fiscal food policies or front-of-pack nutrition labeling. However, due to the complexities of undertaking such research in the real world, well-designed randomized controlled trials on these kinds of interventions are lacking. The Virtual Supermarket is a 3-dimensional computerized research environment designed to enable experimental studies in a supermarket setting without the complexity or costs normally associated with undertaking such research.

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective was to validate the Virtual Supermarket by comparing virtual and real-life food purchasing behavior. A secondary objective was to obtain participant feedback on perceived sense of {\textquotedbl}presence{\textquotedbl} (the subjective experience of being in one place or environment even if physically located in another) in the Virtual Supermarket.

METHODS

Eligible main household shoppers (New Zealand adults aged $\geq$18 years) were asked to conduct 3 shopping occasions in the Virtual Supermarket over 3 consecutive weeks, complete the validated Presence Questionnaire Items Stems, and collect their real supermarket grocery till receipts for that same period. Proportional expenditure (NZ{\$}) and the proportion of products purchased over 18 major food groups were compared between the virtual and real supermarkets. Data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed models.

RESULTS

A total of 123 participants consented to take part in the study. In total, 69.9{\%} (86/123) completed 1 shop in the Virtual Supermarket, 64.2{\%} (79/123) completed 2 shops, 60.2{\%} (74/123) completed 3 shops, and 48.8{\%} (60/123) returned their real supermarket till receipts. The 4 food groups with the highest relative expenditures were the same for the virtual and real supermarkets: fresh fruit and vegetables (virtual estimate: 14.3{\%}; real: 17.4{\%}), bread and bakery (virtual: 10.0{\%}; real: 8.2{\%}), dairy (virtual: 19.1{\%}; real: 12.6{\%}), and meat and fish (virtual: 16.5{\%}; real: 16.8{\%}). Significant differences in proportional expenditures were observed for 6 food groups, with largest differences (virtual - real) for dairy (in expenditure 6.5{\%}, P{\textless}.001; in items 2.2{\%}, P=.04) and fresh fruit and vegetables (in expenditure: -3.1{\%}, P=.04; in items: 5.9{\%}, P=.002). There was no trend of overspending in the Virtual Supermarket and participants experienced a medium-to-high presence (88{\%}, 73/83 scored medium; 8{\%}, 7/83 scored high).

CONCLUSIONS

Shopping patterns in the Virtual Supermarket were comparable to those in real life. Overall, the Virtual Supermarket is a valid tool to measure food purchasing behavior. Nevertheless, it is important to improve the functionality of some food categories, in particular fruit and vegetables and dairy. The results of this validation will assist in making further improvements to the software and with optimization of the internal and external validity of this innovative methodology.},

But could changing the shape (e.g., molding food into cubes or rectangular prisms) or altering the dimensions (e.g., cutting food into thicker or thinner pieces) have unintended consequences in terms of influencing consumers' size perceptions, calorie estimates, or desired consumption volume of the food? Research related to visual inputs and the elongation bias would suggest that thicker and cube-shaped foods would be perceived as larger and higher in calories; however, research related to oral haptic sensory inputs (i.e., the way the food feels in the mouth) would suggest that thinner and rectangular shaped foods would be perceived as larger and higher in calories. We test these competing predictions in a series of three experimental studies and find support for the oral haptic-based hypothesis. Conceptual and managerial implications are discussed.},

@article{Tan.2015b,
 abstract = {Most models of animal choice behaviour assume that desirable but unavailable options, such as a high quality, but inhabited nest sites, do not influence an individual's preferences for the remaining options. However, experiments suggest that in mammals, the mere presence of such 'phantom' alternatives can alter, and even reverse, an individual's preferences for other items in a choice set. Phantom alternatives may be widespread in nature, as they occur whenever a resource is visible, but unavailable at the time of choice. They are particularly relevant for nectar-foraging animals, where previously rewarding flowers may sometimes be empty. Here, we investigate the effect of phantom alternatives on feeder preferences in the eastern honeybee, Apis cerana. First, we tested the effects of unattractive and attractive phantom alternatives by presenting individual bees with either a binary choice set containing two feeders that differed strongly in two qualities, but were equally preferred overall ('option 1' and 'option 2'), or a ternary choice set containing option 1, option 2 and one of two phantom types (unattractive and attractive). Secondly, we determined whether phantoms increase (similarity effect) or decrease (dissimilarity effect) preference for phantom-similar choices. In binary trials, bees had no significant preference for option 1 or option 2. However, after encountering an attractive phantom alternative, individual bees preferred option 2. The unattractive phantom did not influence bee preferences. Phantoms consistently changed individual bee preferences in favour of the phantom-similar choice. This means that the presence of an attractive food source, even if it is unavailable, can influence preference relationships between remaining items in the choice set. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential for phantom effects when studying the foraging behaviour of animals. Our results are particularly relevant for nectarivores, where empty but previously rewarding flowers are a common occurrence. Since an increase in pollinator visits can result in higher seed set, our results open up the possibility that by shifting pollinator preferences, empty flowers could have otherwise-unpredicted influences on community composition, plant-pollinator interactions and pollinator behaviour.},

 abstract = {Trueblood, Brown, and Heathcote (2014) developed a new model, called the multiattribute linear ballistic accumulator (MLBA), to explain contextual preference reversals in multialternative choice. MLBA was shown to provide good accounts of human behavior through both qualitative analyses and quantitative fitting of choice data. Tsetsos, Chater, and Usher (2015) investigated the ability of MLBA to simultaneously capture 3 prominent context effects (attraction, compromise, and similarity). They concluded that MLBA must set a {\textquotedbl}fine balance{\textquotedbl} of competing forces to account for all 3 effects simultaneously and that its predictions are sensitive to the position of the stimuli in the attribute space. Through a new experiment, we show that the 3 effects are very fragile and that only a small subset of people shows all 3 simultaneously. Thus, the predictions that Tsetsos et al. generated from the MLBA model turn out to match closely real data in a new experiment. Support for these predictions provides strong evidence for the MLBA. A corollary is that a model that can {\textquotedbl}robustly{\textquotedbl} capture all 3 effects simultaneously is not necessarily a good model. Rather, a good model captures patterns found in human data, but cannot accommodate patterns that are not found. (PsycINFO Database Record},

These methods were combined with 7 estimators for the amount of residual heterogeneity in the effect sizes. Our results show that the standard method, applied in most meta-analyses up to date, does not control the Type I error rate adequately, sometimes leading to overly conservative, but usually to inflated, Type I error rates. Of the different methods evaluated, only the Knapp and Hartung method and the permutation test provide adequate control of the Type I error rate across all conditions.

These goals may be very specific and precisely planned prior to entering the store, or more abstract, and something we think of on the spur of the moment. The stores may display tens of thousands of different products, making it difficult to achieve the shopping goal in a rational manner. As a result, we use different types of heuristics to meet our shopping goals. In this study, we investigate how a customer's visual attention is influenced by their shopping goal, based on the results of three field experiments in three different contexts---a gas station, a sports store, and a grocery store. Firstly we establish that differences do exist in viewing behavior based on whether shopping goals are planned or unplanned. A more complex and unplanned shopping goal leads to increased observations of in-store stimulus. We then study whether or not the complexity of the first shopping goal also influences the viewing behavior of the next shopping goal, independently of the characteristics of the second goal. The findings confirm that complex decision heuristics deplete cognitive recourse. This finding results in diminished visual attention during subsequent choices. In turn, this has implications for a customer's shopping behavior.},

When customers make these evaluations, their previous experiences in the sequence influence their current evaluation. The authors propose that these prior experiences serve as multiple reference points against which the target stimulus is judged, creating rival co-occurring comparison effects. Using real-world and experimental data, they find that assimilation and contrast effects occur simultaneously: there is assimilation to the first score within a sequence and contrast with the immediate predecessor as well as with extremes experienced earlier in the sequence. The authors document the moderating effects of extreme first stimuli, domain similarity, and individual factors of mood and expertise. They provide different recommendations for sequence construction on the basis of whether the marketer's goal is fairness, accuracy, or influencing choice. This research is unique in (1) showing how several preceding evaluations can each have an impact on a subsequent evaluation at the same time and (2) using real-world data to do so.},

Bayesian inference, machine-learning, incentive alignment, measurement formats, and unstructured direct elicitation

make it feasible and cost-effective to understand, quantify, and simulate ``what-if'' scenarios for a variety

of heuristics. These methods now apply to a broad set of managerial problems including applications in complex

Whereas R{\"o}nkk{\"o} and Evermann claim to be dispelling myths about PLS, they have in reality created new myths that we, in turn, debunk. By examining their claims, our article contributes to reestablishing a constructive discussion of the PLS method and its properties. We show that PLS does offer advantages for exploratory research and that it is a viable estimator for composite factor models. This can pose an interesting alternative if the common factor model does not hold. Therefore, we can conclude that PLS should continue to be used as an important statistical tool for management and organizational research, as well as other social science disciplines.},

 abstract = {Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the introduction of an ``irrelevant'' third option affects preferences between the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles -- a phenomenon known as the ``attraction effect.'' In the studies presented here, however, we contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability of 7.2 and ease of cleaning of 5.5). Such effects do not typically obtain when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). We posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the effect with highly stylized examples, and we question the practical significance of the effect.},

In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.},

 abstract = {Under normal everyday conditions, senses all work together to create experiences that fill a typical person's life. Unfortunately for behavioral and cognitive researchers who investigate such experiences, standard laboratory tests are usually conducted in a nondescript room in front of a computer screen. They are very far from replicating the complexity of real world experiences. Recently, immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments became promising methods to immerse people into an almost real environment that involves more senses. IVR environments provide many similarities to the complexity of the real world and at the same time allow experimenters to constrain experimental parameters to obtain empirical data. This can eventually lead to better treatment options and/or new mechanistic hypotheses. The idea that increasing sensory modalities improve the realism of IVR environments has been empirically supported, but the senses used did not usually include olfaction. In this technology report, we will present an odor delivery system applied to a state-of-the-art IVR technology. The platform provides a three-dimensional, immersive, and fully interactive visualization environment called {\textquotedbl}Brain and Behavioral Laboratory-Immersive System{\textquotedbl} (BBL-IS). The solution we propose can reliably deliver various complex scents during different virtual scenarios, at a precise time and space and without contamination of the environment. The main features of this platform are: (i) the limited cross-contamination between odorant streams with a fast odor delivery ({\textless} 500 ms), (ii) the ease of use and control, and (iii) the possibility to synchronize the delivery of the odorant with pictures, videos or sounds. How this unique technology could be used to investigate typical research questions in olfaction (e.g., emotional elicitation, memory encoding or attentional capture by scents) will also be addressed.},

This random regret minimization (RRM) model, which has recently been introduced in the field of transport, forms a regret-based counterpart of the canonical random utility maximization (RUM) paradigm. This paper assesses empirical results based on 43 comparisons reported in peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, with the aim of finding out to what extent, when, and how RRM can form a viable addition to the consumer choice modeler's toolkit. The paper shows that RRM and hybrid RRM--RUM models outperform RUM counterparts in a majority of cases, in terms of model fit and predictive ability. Although differences in performance are quite small, the two paradigms often result in markedly different managerial implications due to considerable differences in, for example, market share forecasts.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present and test a crucial building block for a regret minimization based choice set formation model, in that it presents a regret based benefit measure for the value associated with adding an alternative to one׳s choice set. By doing so, the paper contributes to existing research which has predominantly adopted a utility-based perspective. I show, using simulations based on a route choice model estimated on stated choice data, that the two perspectives -- regret based and utility based -- generate markedly different benefits. These are caused by the fact that the regret based perspective takes into account choice set composition effects. For example, in line with its behavioral premises, the regret based model predicts that adding an attractive alternative to the set choice only results in a large reduction in regret when the alternative outperforms existing alternatives in terms of every attribute (i.e., becomes a `clear winner'). In general, the benefit of adding a new alternative to one׳s choice set is predicted to be substantially higher by a utility based model, compared to a regret based counterpart. This implies that, to the extent that regret minimization (utility maximization) is an important determinant of decision-making, a utility (regret) based model would overestimate (underestimate) the true size of the decision-maker׳s choice set},

In the baseline (one task) treatment we observe risk behavior in a given choice problem. We show that by integrating a second, asymmetrically dominated choice problem in a random incentive mechanism risk behavior can be manipulated systematically.

The retronasal olfactory function is especially important for flavor appreciation. The aim of this study was to compare retronasal function across different cultures and to develop a test that is applicable across cultures. Identification of 39 retronasal applied odor probes was tested in a total of 518 participants of seven countries; 292 of them were healthy, and 226 exhibited a smell disorder. A retest was performed with 224 of the healthy participants. Furthermore, all participants were tested for orthonasal threshold, identification, and discrimination ability. Significant cultural differences in identification ability were found in 92{\%} of the probes. The 20 probes that could be identified above chance in healthy participants of all countries and that could differentiate between patients and controls were selected for the final retronasal test. This test was well able to differentiate between controls and patients in different countries and showed a good coherence with the orthonasal test (r = 0.80) and a good retest-reliability (r = 0.76). Furthermore, it is age-independent. The strong cultural differences observed in retronasal identification underline the necessity to develop a culturally independent instrument. This retronasal test is easy to apply and can be used across different countries for diagnostics and clinical research.},

@article{Dahlke.2014,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

In October 2012, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began publicly reporting American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) surgical outcomes on its public reporting website, Hospital Compare. Participation in this CMS-NSQIP initiative is voluntary. Our objective was to compare CMS-NSQIP participating hospitals with ACS NSQIP hospitals that elected not to participate.

STUDY DESIGN

Hospital Compare and American Hospital Association Annual Survey data were merged to compare CMS-NSQIP participants with nonparticipants. Regression models were developed to assess predictors of participation and to assess if hospitals differed on 32 process, 10 patient experience (Hospital Consumer Assessment of HealthCare Providers and Systems [HCAHPS]), and 16 outcomes (Hospital Compare and Agency for Healthcare Research Quality) measures. Additionally, performance on 2 waves of publicly reported ACS NSQIP surgical outcomes measures was compared.

RESULTS

Of the 452 ACS NSQIP hospitals, 80 (18{\%}) participated in CMS-NSQIP public reporting. Participating hospitals had more beds, admissions, operations, and were more often accredited (Commission on Cancer and the Council of Teaching Hospitals [COTH] [p {\textless} 0.05]). Only COTH membership remained significant in adjusted analyses (odds ratio 2.45, 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 5.35). Hospital performance on process, HCAHPS, and outcomes measures were not associated with CMS-NSQIP participation for 54 of 58 measures examined. Hospitals with {\textquotedbl}better-than-average{\textquotedbl} performance were more likely to publicly report the Elderly Surgery measure (p {\textless} 0.05). In wave 2, an increased proportion of new participants reported {\textquotedbl}worse-than-average{\textquotedbl} outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

There were few measurable differences between CMS-NSQIP participating and nonparticipating hospitals. The decision to voluntarily publicly report may be related to the hospital's culture of quality improvement and transparency.},

@article{Dalenberg.2014,
 abstract = {Consumers show high interindividual variability in food liking during repeated exposure. To investigate consumer liking during repeated exposure, data is often interpreted on a product level by averaging results over all consumers. However, a single product may elicit inconsistent behaviors in consumers; averaging will mix and hide possible subgroups of consumer behaviors, leading to a misinterpretation of the results. To deal with the variability in consumer liking, we propose to use clustering on data from consumer-product combinations to investigate the nature of the behavioral differences within the complete dataset. The resulting behavioral clusters can then be used to describe product acceptance. To test this approach we used two independent data sets in which young adults were repeatedly exposed to drinks and snacks, respectively. We found that five typical consumer behaviors existed in both datasets. These behaviors differed both in the average level of liking as well as its temporal dynamics. By investigating the distribution of a single product across typical consumer behaviors, we provide more precise insight in how consumers divide in subgroups based on their product liking (i.e. product modality). This work shows that taking into account and using interindividual differences can unveil information about product acceptance that would otherwise be ignored.},

@article{Descheemaeker.2014,
 abstract = {Although some studies have demonstrated that the indirectly measured attitude towards alcohol is related to alcohol use, this relationship has not always been confirmed. In the current study, we attempted to shed light on this issue by investigating whether the predictive validity of an indirect attitude measure is dependent upon attitude accessibility. In a sample of 88 students, the picture-picture naming task, an adaptation of the affective priming paradigm, was used to measure the automatically activated attitude towards beer. Attitude accessibility was measured using a speeded evaluative categorization task. Behavioral measures were the amount of beer poured and drunk during a bogus taste test and the choice between a bottle of beer or water at the end of the experiment. In line with our hypothesis, the indirectly measured attitude towards beer predicted behavior during the taste test only when it was highly accessible. In contrast, this attitude was related to choice behavior irrespective of attitude accessibility. This study confirms that indirect attitude measures can be valuable predictors of alcohol-related behavior, but that it is sometimes necessary to take attitude accessibility into account.},

The effect of such guarantees on perceived product quality and ultimately preference and product choice depends on their perceived value and credibility, related to other extrinsic clues, such as price and brand. An analysis of an experimental design with a national sample of consumers shows that compared with a simple money-back guarantee, a double money-back guarantee does not further increase the relative preference for a retailer brand over a national brand. Furthermore, the size of the effect of a money-back guarantee is small, moderated by the effects of other information on product quality, such as the size of the price differential between retailer and national brands. Finally, the effect of a money-back guarantee differs, depending on the customer--retailer relationship: A retailer with high credibility can influence regular customers less by guarantees.},

@article{Eekhout.2014,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Regardless of the proportion of missing values, complete-case analysis is most frequently applied, although advanced techniques such as multiple imputation (MI) are available. The objective of this study was to explore the performance of simple and more advanced methods for handling missing data in cases when some, many, or all item scores are missing in a multi-item instrument.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING

Real-life missing data situations were simulated in a multi-item variable used as a covariate in a linear regression model. Various missing data mechanisms were simulated with an increasing percentage of missing data. Subsequently, several techniques to handle missing data were applied to decide on the most optimal technique for each scenario. Fitted regression coefficients were compared using the bias and coverage as performance parameters.

RESULTS

Mean imputation caused biased estimates in every missing data scenario when data are missing for more than 10{\%} of the subjects. Furthermore, when a large percentage of subjects had missing items ({\textgreater}25{\%}), MI methods applied to the items outperformed methods applied to the total score.

CONCLUSION

We recommend applying MI to the item scores to get the most accurate regression model estimates. Moreover, we advise not to use any form of mean imputation to handle missing data.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospitals report cards have been put in place within the past few years to increase the amount of publicly reported quality information in Germany. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential of German hospital report cards to improve quality of care. METHODS: First, a systematic Internet search aimed at identifying available report cards was conducted. Second, cross-sectional data (August/September 2013) were analyzed with respect to awareness, comprehension, and impact of report cards by using descriptive analysis and binary multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Hospital report cards (N=62) have become broadly available. However, awareness remains low, about one third (35.6{\%}) of all respondents (N=2027) were aware of German hospital report card. Regarding comprehensibility, in 60.7{\%} of all experiments (N=6081), respondents selected the hospital with the lowest risk-adjusted mortality; significant differences could be determined between the report cards (p{\textless}.001) with scores ranging from 27.5{\%} to 77.2{\%}. Binary multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed different significant respondent-related predictors on each report card. Finally, an impact on hospital choice making was determined. CONCLUSIONS: To increase the potential of hospital report cards, health policy makers should promote the availability of report cards. In addition, the comprehensibility of German hospital report cards cannot be regarded as satisfying and should be enhanced in the future.},

@article{Simonson.2015,
 abstract = {A main objective of Behavioral Decision Theory (BDT) research --- demonstrating that economic theory often fails as a description of decision making as well as gaining insights into systematic influences on judgment and choice --- has been largely accomplished. This influential research program, published in psychology, decision making, marketing, and other fields, has had unique characteristics that combined criteria employed in economics and psychology. Now that the prominent portion of the BDT agenda has been largely completed, it is time to consider whether the BDT and greater judgment and decision making (JDM) community in marketing will pursue a new direction or just follow the topics of the day (e.g., current topics in social psychology, public policy applications of previous JDM findings). I propose a broad research area --- the interaction between the evolving information environment and consumer JDM --- that raises a wide range of important questions and may fit the skills and interests of BDT researchers. In addition to raising new JDM concepts and problems, the proposed area can lead to major revisions of long established frameworks of consumer behavior and marketing. It is far from obvious, however, that BDT researchers/marketing professors, who are accustomed to studying general purpose JDM topics and are aligned with the broader JDM and social psychology community, will be receptive to a consumer-centric research program.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preference for the status quo, or clinical inertia, is a barrier to implementing treat-to-target protocols in patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objectives of this study were to examine the influence of subjective numeracy on RA-patient preference for the status quo and to determine whether age modifies this relationship. METHODS: RA patients participated in a single face-to-face interview. Numeracy was measured using the Subjective Numeracy Scale. Treatment preference was measured using Adaptive Conjoint Analysis. RESULTS: Of 205 eligible subjects, 156 agreed to participate. Higher subjective numeracy was associated with lower preference for the status quo in a regression model including race, employment, and use of biologics (adjusted odds ratio [95{\%} confidence interval] = 0.71 [0.52-0.95], P = 0.02). Higher subjective numeracy was protective against status quo preferences among subjects younger than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [95{\%} confidence interval] = 0.64 (0.43-0.94), P = 0.02) but not among older subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective numeracy is independently associated with younger, but not older, RA patients' preferences for the status quo. Our results add to the literature demonstrating age and numeracy differences in treatment preferences and medical decision-making processes.},

 abstract = {Over the last few decades, wine makers have been producing wines with a higher alcohol content, assuming that they are more appreciated by consumers. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic imaging to compare reactions of human subjects to different types of wine, focusing on brain regions critical for flavor processing and food reward. Participants were presented with carefully matched pairs of high- and low-alcohol content red wines, without informing them of any of the wine attributes. Contrary to expectation, significantly greater activation was found for low-alcohol than for high-alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity, including the insula as well as the cerebellum. Wines were closely matched for all physical attributes except for alcohol content, thus we interpret the preferential response to the low-alcohol content wines as arising from top-down modulation due to the low alcohol content wines inducing greater attentional exploration of aromas and flavours. The findings raise intriguing possibilities for objectively testing hypotheses regarding methods of producing a highly complex product such as wine.},

@article{Hainmueller.2015,
 abstract = {Survey experiments, like vignette and conjoint analyses, are widely used in the social sciences to elicit stated preferences and study how humans make multidimensional choices. However, there is a paucity of research on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant attributes generate support for naturalization with closely corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland, where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from the same population and the official descriptions of applicant characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are within 2{\%} percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Our aim was to derive a short version of the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) using data from 412 adolescents of the Swiss HERMES (Health Effects Related to Mobile phonE use in adolescentS) cohort.

METHODS

A German version of the original MPPUS consisting of 27 items was shortened by principal component analysis (PCA) using baseline data collected in 2012. For confirmation, the PCA was carried out again with follow-up data 1~year later.

RESULTS

PCA revealed four factors related to symptoms of addiction (Loss of Control, Withdrawal, Negative Life Consequences and Craving) and a fifth factor reflecting the social component of mobile phone use (Peer Dependence). The shortened scale (MPPUS-10) highly reflects the original MPPUS (Kendalls' Tau: 0.80 with 90{\%} concordant pairs). Internal consistency of MPPUS-10 was good with Cronbach's alpha: 0.85. The results were confirmed using the follow-up data.

CONCLUSIONS

The MPPUS-10 is a suitable instrument for research in adolescents. It will help to further clarify the definition of problematic mobile phone use in adolescents and explore similarities and differences to other technological addictions.},

@article{Brighton.2015,
 abstract = {In marketing and finance, surprisingly simple models sometimes predict more accurately than more complex, sophisticated models. Here, we address the question of when and why simple models succeed --- or fail --- by framing the forecasting problem in terms of the bias--variance dilemma. Controllable error in forecasting consists of two components, the ``bias'' and the ``variance''. We argue that the benefits of simplicity are often overlooked because of a pervasive ``bias bias'': the importance of the bias component of prediction error is inflated, and the variance component of prediction error, which reflects an oversensitivity of a model to different samples from the same population, is neglected. Using the study of cognitive heuristics, we discuss how to reduce variance by ignoring weights, attributes, and dependencies between attributes, and thus make better decisions. Bias and variance, we argue, offer a more insightful perspective on the benefits of simplicity than Occam''s razor.},

Plott and Zeiler (Am Econ Rev 95:530--545, 2005) replicate this willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept ``gap'' with conventional experimental procedures, but find no gap after implementing procedures that provide for subject anonymity and familiarity with the second-price mechanism. This paper investigates whether anonymity is necessary for their result. We employ both types of procedures with and without anonymity. Contrary to predictions of one theory---which suggest social pressures may cause differences in subject valuations---we find, regardless of anonymity, conventional procedures generate gaps and Plott and Zeiler's does not. These findings strongly suggest subject familiarity with elicitation mechanisms, not anonymity, is responsible for the variability in results across value-elicitation experiments. As an application to experimental design methodology, there appears to be little need to impose anonymity when using second-price mechanisms in standard consumer good experiments.},

Although line extensions may lead to cannibalization and reduction of overall profits, the bulk of theoretical and empirical research suggests that product line extensions result in a net gain of overall demand and market share. To mitigate cannibalization, the extant literature prescribes the addition of premium versions of products: an upward line extension, with the intention of achieving not only gains in demand and market share, but also in overall profit.



In this research, we employ analytical and empirical methods to make the case that upward line extensions aimed at matching a competing product's attribute may lead consumers to reassess their perceptions about the brand and attributes of the products in the market in a way that erodes the advantages of the firm extending its product line. Ultimately, this can result in a loss of demand, market share, and profit for the extending firm.},

 abstract = {$\backslash$$\backslash$]$\backslash$$\backslash$Recent research suggests that non-attentively perceived stimuli may significantly influence consumers' food choices. The main objective of the present study was to determine whether an olfactory prime (a sweet-fatty odour) and a semantic auditory prime (a nutritional prevention message), both presented incidentally, either alone or in combination can influence subsequent food choices. The experiment included 147 participants who were assigned to four different conditions: a control condition, a scented condition, an auditory condition or an auditory-scented condition. All participants remained in the waiting room during15 min while they performed a 'lure' task. For the scented condition, the participants were unobtrusively exposed to a 'pain au chocolat' odour. Those in the auditory condition were exposed to an audiotape including radio podcasts and a nutritional message. A third group of participants was exposed to both olfactory and auditory stimuli simultaneously. In the control condition, no stimulation was given. Following this waiting period, all participants moved into a non-odorised test room where they were asked to choose, from dishes served buffet-style, the starter, main course and dessert that they would actually eat for lunch. The results showed that the participants primed with the odour of 'pain au chocolat' tended to choose more desserts with high energy density (i.e., a waffle) than the participants in the control condition (p = 0.06). Unexpectedly, the participants primed with the nutritional auditory message chose to consume more desserts with high energy density than the participants in the control condition (p = 0.03). In the last condition (odour and nutritional message), they chose to consume more desserts with high energy density than the participants in the control condition (p = 0.01), and the data reveal an additive effect of the two primes.},

This research posits that decision task type affect the attraction effect. People usually seek justification for their decisions. In a selection (or rejection) task, they are more likely to emphasize the positive (or negative) features of each option. The addition of an asymmetrically dominated decoy to a binary set of options undoubtedly provides an extra positive feature for the dominant option, and therefore induces a greater attraction effect. Contrarily, in a rejection task condition, the decoy in the trinary set seems to be the worst option and would be eliminated first, and the remaining comparison is identical with the original binary condition. Therefore, the attraction effect may decrease. Besides, the decision task type interacts with the construal level to affect the attraction effect. Specifically, a low construal level, compared with a high construal level, dampens the attraction effect to a greater extent in a rejection task than in a selection task. Results from three experiments support the proposed hypotheses.},

As such, the aim of this study was to identify the cross-modal influence of color on the sense of touch. In four experiments involving food products, the cross-modal interaction between color and texture was found to be automatic, unlearned, and a moderating effect on perceived texture. Furthermore, results indicate a person's haptic predisposition, or ``need for touch,'' influences their sensitivity to these cross-modal effects. This research builds on current theory involving color, presents a number of areas for future research, and discusses managerial implications of color--texture cross-modal interactions.},

 abstract = {Previous experimental research suggests that individuals apply rules of thumb to a simplified mental model of the ``real'' decision problem. We claim that this simplification is obtained either by neglecting the other players' incentives and beliefs or by taking them into consideration only for a subset of game outcomes. We analyze subjects' eye movements while playing a series of two-person, 3 $\times$ 3 one-shot games in normal form. Games within each class differ by a set of descriptive features (i.e., features that can be changed without altering the game equilibrium properties). Data show that subjects on average perform partial or non-strategic analysis of the payoff matrix, often ignoring the opponent´s payoffs and rarely performing the necessary steps to detect dominance. Our analysis of eye-movements supports the hypothesis that subjects use simple decision rules such as ``choose the strategy with the highest average payoff'' or ``choose the strategy leading to an attractive and symmetric outcome'' without (optimally) incorporating knowledge on the opponent's behavior. Lookup patterns resulted being feature and game invariant, heterogeneous across subjects, but stable within subjects. Using a cluster analysis, we find correlations between eye-movements and choices; however, applying the Cognitive Hierarchy model to our data, we show that only some of the subjects present both information search patterns and choices compatible with a specific cognitive level. We also find a series of correlations between strategic behavior and individual characteristics like risk attitude, short-term memory capacity, and mathematical and logical abilities.},

Thus, unprecedented volume, velocity, and variety of primary data, Big Data, are available from individual consumers. To better understand the impact of Big Data on various marketing activities, enabling firms to better exploit its benefits, a conceptual framework that builds on resource-based theory is proposed. Three resources---physical, human, and organizational capital---moderate the following: (1) the process of collecting and storing evidence of consumer activity as Big Data, (2) the process of extracting consumer insight from Big Data, and (3) the process of utilizing consumer insight to enhance dynamic/adaptive capabilities. Furthermore, unique resource requirements for firms to benefit from Big Data are discussed},

@article{Huang.2015,
 abstract = {Prior research on product out-of-stock (OOS) has mainly focused on the consequences of OOS due to consumers not being able to select their target options. The present research explores how OOS noticed by consumers without a specific target option in mind affects their preference among the in-stock options. We find that consumers can draw social inferences from OOS about the desirability of product features. Consequently, in-stock options that share feature with the OOS option enjoys choice advantage. We show that this effect occurs only when the OOS condition is caused by consumer demand (as opposed to by logistical causes), and only for consumers who are not product category experts. Further, consumers' belief on others' expertise and shopping goal determines which specific feature they will identify as the key feature that drives the OOS. These findings provide a more complete picture for how consumers respond to OOS. They also offer insights into making more accurate demand estimation and suggest a potential new tool for in-store marketing.},

Here we show that humans can do so. Using a spatial match-to-sample procedure, humans were led to a random location within a room diffused with two odors. After brief sampling and spatial disorientation, they had to return to this location. Over three conditions, participants had access to different sensory stimuli: olfactory only, visual only, and a final control condition with no olfactory, visual, or auditory stimuli. Humans located the target with higher accuracy in the olfaction-only condition than in the control condition and showed higher accuracy than chance. Thus a mechanism long proposed for the homing pigeon, the ability to define a location on a map constructed from chemical stimuli, may also be a navigational mechanism used by humans.},

@article{Jonge.2015,
 abstract = {Contemporary production and consumption are often characterised by negative externalities, for example regarding animal welfare. Despite consumer concerns about animal welfare standards in livestock production systems, the market share of organic meat is still low. The current paper investigates to what extent a more differentiated product assortment including ``compromise alternatives'', providing consumers with more options to trade-off animal welfare against other attributes, increases the choice share of meat produced at beyond-regulatory standards for animal welfare. Results from a choice experiment in The Netherlands reveal considerable heterogeneity in consumer preferences regarding the trade-off between animal welfare level and price level. Two out of six segments, typically consumers with a lower education level and shoppers at discount supermarkets, are not or hardly prepared to pay a price premium for welfare enhanced meat. Two other segments show a preference for small increases in animal welfare level and associated costs. The remaining two other segments seem to reflect ``protestors'' against mainstream meat production in that they hold negative attitudes, beliefs and feelings regarding the consumption of conventionally-produced meat, either by turning to meat produced at high animal welfare standards (including meat replacement products) or by reducing meat consumption. It is concluded that an assortment that better caters for this heterogeneity in consumer preference by including ``compromise meat products'' is of the benefit to both the individual consumer (preferences), the animal (animal welfare levels) and the meat sector (clientele).},

@article{Rolls.2015,
 abstract = {Complementary neuronal recordings in primates, and functional neuroimaging in humans, show that the primary taste cortex in the anterior insula provides separate and combined representations of the taste, temperature, and texture (including fat texture) of food in the mouth independently of hunger and thus of reward value and pleasantness. One synapse on, in a second tier of processing, in the orbitofrontal cortex, these sensory inputs are for some neurons combined by associative learning with olfactory and visual inputs, and these neurons encode food reward value on a continuous scale in that they only respond to food when hungry, and in that activations correlate linearly with subjective pleasantness. Cognitive factors, including word-level descriptions, and selective attention to affective value, modulate the representation of the reward value of taste and olfactory stimuli in the orbitofrontal cortex and a region to which it projects, the anterior cingulate cortex, a tertiary taste cortical area. The food reward representations formed in this way play an important role in the control of appetite, and food intake. Individual differences in these reward representations may contribute to obesity, and there are age-related differences in these value representations that shape the foods that people in different age groups find palatable. In a third tier of processing in medial prefrontal cortex area 10, decisions between stimuli of different reward value are taken, by attractor decision-making networks.},

@article{Salerno.2015,
 abstract = {Prior research has demonstrated that while people experience pride after an accomplishment, its experience can both encourage and discourage subsequent regulatory behavior. The current research shows that this seemingly contradictory influence can be accounted for by considering the information about the event that generated the pride (i.e., appraisal information) and whether or not a self-regulatory goal is active. In the absence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning the locus of control (e.g., ``I contributed to this achievement; it was not luck'') can be used to make positive inferences about one's self-concept that reinforce further self-regulation. In the presence of a self-regulatory goal, appraisal information concerning personal agency (e.g., ``This was my achievement, not someone else's achievement'') can be used to make positive inferences about one's progress toward self-regulation that, in turn, licenses indulgence. Thus appraisal information and the presence of self-regulatory goals is critical to how a self-conscious emotion like pride influences subsequent behavior. Implications and potential extensions in the areas of self-conscious emotions, goals, and self-regulation are discussed.},

@article{Schrift.2015,
 abstract = {Decision making often entails conflict. In many situations, the symptoms of such decisional conflict are conspicuous. This article explores an important and unexamined question: How does observing someone else experiencing decisional conflict impact our own preferences? The authors show that observing others' emotional conflict and agony over an impending decision makes the observer's preferences converge to those of the conflicted actor (i.e., choose similarly). Thus this article contributes to the social influence literature by demonstrating that observers' preferences are not only influenced by an actor's ultimate choice, but also by the process leading to this choice. For example, in one experiment, participants' real monetary donations to one of two charities converged to those of a paid confederate who agonized over the decision. Six studies demonstrate this effect and show that it is triggered by empathy and a greater sense of shared identity with the conflicted actor. Accordingly, the studies show the effect is more pronounced for individuals with a greater tendency to empathize with others, and that convergence occurs only if participants deem the actor's conflict warranted given the decision at hand. The authors also demonstrate important implications of this effect in contexts of group decision making.},

 abstract = {The effects of written information of key sensory characteristics of apple cultivars on hedonic ratings and willingness to pay (WTP) were measured in an experimental auction. Participants (n = 118, 95F, 23M, mean age 37 y.) rated, in three subsequent rounds, pleasantness and WTP based on (1) appearance only (n = 25), (2) appearance, written information and tasting (n = 44), or (3) appearance, tasting and written information (n = 49). Four domestic cultivars were described as medium sour and crispy (`Amorosa'), sour and medium crispy (`Konsta'), medium sweet and medium crispy (`Lobo') and sweet and medium crispy (`Tobias'). The differences between the cultivars in pleasantness and WTP were minimal when the evaluation was based on appearance only. The effect of tasting after visual inspection was positive in three cultivars and negative in one (`Konsta'). Written information after tasting did not affect pleasantness or WTP. For one cultivar (`Tobias'), information given before tasting created expectations that were not fulfilled, thus tasting decreased hedonic ratings and WTP. Mean WTP was 2.36 euro/kg. When pleasantness increased by one point, WTP increased by 0.31--0.45 euro/kg. Regression models showed that pleasantness explained 38--55{\%} of WTP. Respondents who reported consuming domestic apples more often than once a week had 0.52--0.74 euro/kg higher WTP than those who consumed them less frequently, suggesting that familiarity with the product increases WTP. Results indicate that both written information and tasting contribute to the ratings of pleasantness and WTP.},

Given the need of many European health care systems to contain costs, the question of how to prioritise genetic tests fairly has become an emerging concern. This study uses a discrete-choice experiment to assess the value judgements of clinical geneticists, patient representatives and other stakeholders regarding the prioritisation of genetic tests. The respondents chose between two hypothetical scenarios that differed in severity of the disease, risk of the disease, aim of the test, medical benefit of the test, and costs of the test. Standard logit models and mixed effects models were used to estimate the weights different stakeholders attached to attribute levels. Responses from 594 participants were analysed. The most highly valued attribute levels were a proven medical benefit of the test, high risk of having the disease and low costs of the test. Results also showed that rankings differ between clinical geneticists and other stakeholders. The priority weights determined within this study can inform the policy debate and improve the consistency of prioritisation in genetics. Further stakeholder deliberation is needed to explore their most appropriate use in decision practice.},

 abstract = {For optimal solutions in health care, decision makers inevitably must evaluate trade-offs, which call for multi-attribute valuation methods. Researchers have proposed using best-worst scaling (BWS) methods which seek to extract information from respondents by asking them to identify the best and worst items in each choice set. While a companion paper describes the different types of BWS, application and their advantages and downsides, this contribution expounds their relationships with microeconomic theory, which also have implications for statistical inference. This article devotes to the microeconomic foundations of preference measurement, also addressing issues such as scale invariance and scale heterogeneity. Furthermore the paper discusses the basics of preference measurement using rating, ranking and stated choice data in the light of the findings of the preceding section. Moreover the paper gives an introduction to the use of stated choice data and juxtaposes BWS with the microeconomic foundations.},

 abstract = {Extant research on choice designs in marketing focuses on the construction of efficient homogeneous designs where all respondents get the same design. Recently marketing scholars proposed the construction of efficient heterogeneous designs where different respondents or groups of respondents get different subdesigns, and demonstrated substantial efficiency gain when such heterogeneous designs are employed. A significant hurdle in the widespread adoption of heterogeneous designs is the high computation cost, even when the number of subdesigns contained in the heterogeneous design is restricted to be small. In this paper we propose a new approach for the construction of efficient heterogeneous choice designs. In contrast to extant approaches that are based on an exact design framework where it is computationally prohibitive to do an exhaustive search to find a globally optimal design, our proposed approach is based on the continuous design framework where well-established mathematical theories can be leveraged for quick identification of a globally optimal design. The proposed approach makes it feasible to generate a highly efficient choice design that is completely heterogeneous---a unique subdesign for each individual respondent in the choice experiment. The proposed approach is the first in the marketing literature to find a completely heterogeneous choice design with assured high global design efficiency using the continuous design framework. Results from simulation and empirical studies demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach over extant approaches in constructing efficient heterogeneous choice designs.},

This study addresses premium durables in an international context, based on a qualified sample of 1,650 real customers.

A Monte Carlo simulation identifies the significant revenue opportunities missed by applying direct methods of WTP assessment common to most popular business practices.

In contrasts, we have encouraged ``conceptual replications'' (replicating at the construct level but with different operationalization) and ``replications with extensions'', reflecting our interest in providing evidence on the external validity and generalizability of published findings. In particular, our belief is that this replication philosophy allows for both replication and the creation of new knowledge. We express our views about why we believe our approach is more constructive, and describe lessons learned in the three years we have been involved in editing the IJRM Replication Corner.

Surveys of researchers across a wide variety of fields (including medicine, epidemiology, cognitive science, psychology, business, and economics) show that a substantial majority does indeed do so.

That is, it remains completely silent on the explicit influence of others in the formation of consumer preferences. This paper proposes a new holistic framework of preference, PIE, as well as a measurement method to remedy this problem. The new paradigm posits that consumers evaluate products based on different ``needs'' which are determined by three sources: (1) P, the physical attributes of the product; (2) I, the individual characteristics of the choice maker; and (3) E, characteristics of an external peer group. To provide an empirically feasible method to capture all three sources of information, we propose and test an incentive-aligned approach, a group-sourced mechanism, which mimics a real life consultation of a consumer making a purchase decision in the presence of her friends. Our results provide support for the PIE framework, including superior predictive performance in a conjoint task that is ``stacked against it''. We also show how firms can apply the PIE framework for product design. Practitioners, however, must weigh carefully the benefits of the group-sourced preference measurement with the heavier cognitive burden on the respondents in completing the task.},

In sensory systems, divisive normalization seems to be a canonical neural computation, observed in areas ranging from retina to cortex and mediating processes including contrast adaptation, surround suppression, visual attention, and multisensory integration. Recent electrophysiological studies have extended these insights beyond the sensory domain, demonstrating an analogous algorithm for the value signals that guide decision making, but the effects of normalization on choice behavior are unknown. Here, we show that choice models using normalization generate significant (and classically irrational) choice phenomena driven by either the value or number of alternative options. In value-guided choice experiments, both monkey and human choosers show novel context-dependent behavior consistent with normalization. These findings suggest that the neural mechanism of value coding critically influences stochastic choice behavior and provide a generalizable quantitative framework for examining context effects in decision making.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Previous work has noted that science stands as an ideological force insofar as the answers it offers to a variety of fundamental questions and concerns; as such, those who pursue scientific inquiry have been shown to be concerned with the moral and social ramifications of their scientific endeavors. No studies to date have directly investigated the links between exposure to science and moral or prosocial behaviors.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Across four studies, both naturalistic measures of science exposure and experimental primes of science led to increased adherence to moral norms and more morally normative behaviors across domains. Study 1 (n = 36) tested the natural correlation between exposure to science and likelihood of enforcing moral norms. Studies 2 (n = 49), 3 (n = 52), and 4 (n = 43) manipulated thoughts about science and examined the causal impact of such thoughts on imagined and actual moral behavior. Across studies, thinking about science had a moralizing effect on a broad array of domains, including interpersonal violations (Studies 1, 2), prosocial intentions (Study 3), and economic exploitation (Study 4).

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

These studies demonstrated the morally normative effects of lay notions of science. Thinking about science leads individuals to endorse more stringent moral norms and exhibit more morally normative behavior. These studies are the first of their kind to systematically and empirically test the relationship between science and morality. The present findings speak to this question and elucidate the value-laden outcomes of the notion of science.},

Consumers, who face budget or geographical constraints, for example, end up with mostly undesirable consideration sets; yet a choice is necessary. We examine the role of option set desirability in the context of the well-established attraction effect. In five studies, we show that the attraction effect occurs in desirable domains but is eliminated when all the options are undesirable (Experiments 1-4). We further find that this asymmetric effect is consistent with a shift in decision makers' processing styles. Decision makers' show more vigilant processing when making choices among undesirable (vs. desirable) domains (Experiments 3A and 3B), which results in an attenuated attraction effect (Experiment 4). Our results indicate that the attraction effect might not be as robust as generally thought and establishes (un)desirability as an important boundary condition.},

 abstract = {We are highly sympathetic to Dhar and Gorlin's goal of developing a dual system theory of choice. But we do feel that the proposal could be

changed and clarified in a few ways. Specifically, we believe that the evidence suggests that the systems operate in parallel, not sequentially. In

addition, the relation between intuitive/associative processing and affect remains unresolved, a vagueness that is especially troublesome for the

problem of choice. Relatedly, the description of System I as perceptual requires further explanation and refinement. Finally, we reconsider the

attribution of the compromise effect to deliberative processing and propose an alternative explanation, one that reveals one aspect of the interaction

between intuitive and deliberative processes. While further specification and testing of predictions are necessary, the proposal by Dhar and Gorlin

makes a substantive contribution toward understanding how choices are made.},

We report data from two foraging tasks used to investigate age differences in search in external environments as well as internal search in memory. Overall, the evidence suggests that foraging behavior may undergo significant changes across the life span across internal and external search. In particular, we find evidence of a trend toward reduced exploration with increased age. We discuss these findings in light of theories that postulate a link between aging and reductions in novelty seeking and exploratory behavior.},

@book{Levy.2013,
 abstract = {A trusted classic on the key methods in population sampling---now in a modernized and expanded new editionSampling of Populations, Fourth Edition continues to serve as an all-inclusive resource on the basic and most current practices in population sampling. Maintaining the clear and accessible style of the previous edition, this book outlines the essential statistical methodsfor survey design and analysis, while also exploring techniques that have developed over the past decade.The Fourth Editionsuccessfully guides the reader through the basic concepts and procedures that accompany real-world sample surveys, such as sampling designs, problems of missing data, statistical analysis of multistage sampling data, and nonresponse and poststratification adjustment procedures. Rather than employ a heavily mathematical approach, the authors present illustrative examples that demonstrate the rationale behind common steps in the sampling process, from creating effective surveys to analyzing collected data. Along with established methods, modern topics are treated through the book's new features, which include:A new chapter on telephone sampling, with coverage of declining response rates, the creation of 'do not call' lists, and the growing use of cellular phonesA new chapter on sample weighting that focuses on adjustments to weight for nonresponse, frame deficiencies, and the effects of estimator instabilityAn updated discussion of sample survey data analysis that includes analytic procedures for estimation and hypothesis testingA new section on Chromy's widely used method of taking probability proportional to size samples with minimum replacement of primary sampling unitsAn expanded index with references on the latest research in the fieldAll of the book's examples and exercises can be easily worked out using various software packages including SAS, STATA, and SUDAAN, and an extensive FTP site contains additional data sets. With its comprehensive presentation and wealth of relevant examples, Sampling of Populations, Fourth Edition is an ideal book for courses on survey sampling at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for practicing statisticians who would like to refresh their knowledge of sampling techniques.  Paul S.

@article{Mobbs.2013,
 abstract = {Input-matching is a key mechanism by which animals optimally distribute themselves across habitats to maximize net gains based on the changing input values of food supply rate and competition. To examine the neural systems that underlie this rule in humans, we created a continuous-input foraging task where subjects had to decide to stay or switch between two habitats presented on the left and right of the screen. The subject's decision to stay or switch was based on changing input values of reward-token supply rate and competition density. High density of competition or low-reward token rate was associated with decreased chance of winning. Therefore, subjects attempted to maximize their gains by switching to habitats that possessed low competition density and higher token rate. When it was increasingly disadvantageous to be in a habitat, we observed increased activity in brain regions that underlie preparatory motor actions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, as well as the insula, which we speculate may be involved in the conscious urge to switch habitats. Conversely, being in an advantageous habitat is associated with activity in the reward systems, namely the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, amygdala and dorsal putamen activity steered interindividual preferences in competition avoidance and pursuing reward. Our results suggest that input-matching decisions are made as a net function of activity in a distributed set of neural systems. Furthermore, we speculate that switching behaviors are related to individual differences in competition avoidance and reward drive.},

to search when faced with a single option. This effect can lead to a product being

chosen more often when competing alternatives are included in the choice set,

choice conflict showing that additional options can lead to higher deferral rates. A

series of lab studies document this effect, differentiate it from other context effects,

aversion is not driven by the information provided by the additional options, that

the desire to search is critical for this effect to occur, and that the effects of singleoption

aversion are not limited to the immediate choice set. These results have

both practical and theoretical implications for the understanding of consumer search

Sensory evaluation is a scientific discipline used to evoke, measure, analyse and interpret responses to products perceived through the senses of sight, smell, touch, taste and hearing. It is used to reveal insights into the way in which sensory properties drive consumer acceptance and behaviour, and to design products that best deliver what the consumer wants. It is also used at a more fundamental level to provide a wider understanding of the mechanisms involved in sensory perception and consumer behaviour.

@article{Goodman.2013,
 abstract = {Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor system run by Amazon.com, provides quick, easy, and inexpensive access to online research participants. As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample's attitudes but similar to students' attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect---with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results},

 abstract = {Stated-preference methods are a class of evaluation techniques for studying the preferences of patients and other stakeholders. While these methods span a variety of techniques, conjoint-analysis methods-and particularly discrete-choice experiments (DCEs)-have become the most frequently applied approach in health care in recent years. Experimental design is an important stage in the development of such methods, but establishing a consensus on standards is hampered by lack of understanding of available techniques and software. This report builds on the previous ISPOR Conjoint Analysis Task Force Report: Conjoint Analysis Applications in Health-A Checklist: A Report of the ISPOR Good Research Practices for Conjoint Analysis Task Force. This report aims to assist researchers specifically in evaluating alternative approaches to experimental design, a difficult and important element of successful DCEs. While this report does not endorse any specific approach, it does provide a guide for choosing an approach that is appropriate for a particular study. In particular, it provides an overview of the role of experimental designs for the successful implementation of the DCE approach in health care studies, and it provides researchers with an introduction to constructing experimental designs on the basis of study objectives and the statistical model researchers have selected for the study. The report outlines the theoretical requirements for designs that identify choice-model preference parameters and summarizes and compares a number of available approaches for constructing experimental designs. The task-force leadership group met via bimonthly teleconferences and in person at ISPOR meetings in the United States and Europe. An international group of experimental-design experts was consulted during this process to discuss existing approaches for experimental design and to review the task force's draft reports. In addition, ISPOR members contributed to developing a consensus report by submitting written comments during the review process and oral comments during two forum presentations at the ISPOR 16th and 17th Annual International Meetings held in Baltimore (2011) and Washington, DC (2012).},

 abstract = {Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25-50:1, and to 100-200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

We examined how positive fantasies about the resolution of a crisis (i.e., a lack of pain medication in Sierra Leone, the risk of flooding after Hurricane Irene) influence people's agreement to donate to charitable efforts directed at crisis resolution. In three studies, positive fantasies dampened the likelihood of agreeing to donate a relatively large amount of money, effort, or time, but did not affect the likelihood of agreeing to donate a relatively small amount of these resources. The effect of positive fantasies was mediated by perceiving the donation of larger (but not smaller) amounts of resources as overly demanding. These findings suggest that charitable solicitations requesting small donations might benefit from stimulating positive fantasies in potential donors, but those requesting large donations could be hurt.},

Comparison selection depends on the latitude of acceptance, comparison fluency, and the interaction between these factors. Importantly, these factors integrate a wide variety of seemingly unrelated variables, and the theory is useful for generating novel hypotheses. However, because comparative processing occurs relatively infrequently, it is important to take a step back and specify the conditions under which comparative processing is likely to occur. Comparative processing is likely only when the motivation and the opportunity to process information carefully are high, when consumers lack knowledge about distributional standards, or when stimulus-based judgment is likely. The two types of processes have different antecedents, consequences, and implications for debiasing},

When directly comparing the two strong brands cues, more activation in the right amygdala was found for Coca Cola cues compared with Pepsi Cola cues. During the taste phase the same beverage elicited stronger activation in left ventral striatum when it was previously announced by a strong compared with a weak brand. This effect was stronger in participants who drink Cola infrequently and might therefore point to a stronger reliance on brand cues in less experienced consumers.

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

In particular, consumers unfamiliar with the product domain have difficulties to see differences in choice sets and to process information. In order to facilitate choice-making for novices buying simple, non-complex products, Mogilner, Rudnick, and Iyengar (2008) propose that retailers provide some -- indeed any -- form of categorization in the presentation of large assortments. Mogilner et al. observe a so-called mere categorization effect for novices but not for experts; irrespective of the actual content of category labels, categories for simple products increase perceived variety and choice satisfaction of novices. The present studies investigate the categorization hypothesis for complex products (cell phones). The main hypothesis is that the mere categorization effect will not hold for novices buying complex products. In the first experiment, for novices, only informative category labels applied to the options reduce perceived difficulty of choosing. For experts, category labels, mere or informative, have no effect on perceived difficulty of choosing. However, a second experiment identifies affect as an important moderator of categorization. When buying a complex product affectively, novices show a pattern similar to the mere categorization effect. For complex products, uninformative category labels are just as effective as informative labels for novices deciding affectively.},

The authors propose and show evidence for the mechanism underlying these effects: that the concept of balance is metaphorically linked in the mind to the concept of parity and that activating balance increases the accessibility of the parity concept. The increased accessibility of parity changes consumer perceptions of the product offerings in a choice set, increasing the selection of compromise options because they provide parity on the described product attributes.},

The best-established conclusion is that low serotonin function after tryptophan depletion lowers mood in some people. However, this does not mean that other variables, altered after tryptophan depletion, are necessarily related to low serotonin. Each aspect of brain function has to be assessed separately. Furthermore, a negative tryptophan depletion study does not mean that low serotonin cannot influence the variable studied.

@article{Zarzo.2013,
 abstract = {Perfumes are manufactured by mixing odorous materials with different volatilities. The parameter that measures the lasting property of a material when applied on the skin is called substantivity or tenacity. It is well known by perfumers that citrus and green notes are perceived as fresh and they tend to evaporate quickly, while odors most dissimilar to 'fresh' (e.g., oriental, powdery, erogenic and animalic scents) are tenacious. However, studies aimed at quantifying the relationship between fresh odor quality and substantivity have not received much attention. In this work, perceptual olfactory ratings on a fresh scale, estimated in a previous study, were compared with substantivity parameters and antierogenic ratings from the literature. It was found that the correlation between fresh odor character and odorant substantivity is quite strong (r = -0.85). 'Fresh' is sometimes interpreted in perfumery as 'cool' and the opposite of 'warm'. This association suggests that odor freshness might be somehow related to temperature. Assuming that odor perception space was shaped throughout evolution in temperate climates, results reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that 'fresh' evokes scents typically encountered in the cool season, while 'warm' would be evoked by odors found in nature during summer. This hypothesis is rather simplistic but it may provide a new insight to better understand the perceptual space of scents.},

and predict financial outcomes. While many firms focus

on customer satisfaction metrics for this purpose, dual-process

theories in psychology and neuroscience show that customer

decisions are based on two processes. This suggests that

metrics which measure the impulsiveness of purchase decisions

might effectively complement customer satisfaction metrics. In

a series of experiments we demonstrate that satisfaction and

impulsiveness metrics make distinct but strong predictions of

consumer choices. Satisfaction and impulsiveness influence

choice in different ways. While impulsiveness relates to choice

directly, the satisfaction-choice path is mediated by loyalty

intention. Moreover this relationship is moderated by product

involvement such that impulsiveness metrics provide a better

prediction for low-involvement than for high-involvement

situations. Finally, a field study of 750 customers of 101 firms

demonstrates these relationships at a firm level, indicating that

satisfaction and impulsiveness metrics have equally strong but

distinct relationships with shareholder value. Therefore firms

may be able to benefit from complementing customer

satisfaction metrics with customer impulsiveness metrics.},

Recent research on embodied cognition has shown that feelings of social warmth or coldness can be induced by experiences of physical warmth or coldness, and vice versa. Here we show that people tend to self-regulate their feelings of social warmth through applications of physical warmth, apparently without explicit awareness of doing so. In Study 1, higher scores on a measure of chronic loneliness (social coldness) were associated with an increased tendency to take warm baths or showers. In Study 2, a physical coldness manipulation significantly increased feelings of loneliness. In Study 3, needs for social affiliation and for emotion regulation, triggered by recall of a past rejection experience, were subsequently eliminated by an interpolated physical warmth experience. Study 4 provided evidence that people are not explicitly aware of the relationship between physical and social warmth (coldness), as they do not consider a target person who often bathes to be any lonelier than one who does not, with all else being equal. Together, these findings suggest that physical and social warmth are to some extent substitutable in daily life and that this substitution reflects an unconscious self-regulatory mechanism.},

Based on this previous review, and a number of other key review papers, focus is given to three issues: experimental design; estimation procedures; and validity of responses. Consideration is also given to how DCEs are applied and reported. We identified 114 DCEs, covering a wide range of policy questions. Applications took place in a broader range of health-care systems, and there has been a move to incorporating fewer attributes, more choices and interview-based surveys. There has also been a shift towards statistically more efficient designs and flexible econometric models. The reporting of monetary values continues to be popular, the use of utility scores has not gained popularity, and there has been an increasing use of odds ratios and probabilities. The latter are likely to be useful at the policy level to investigate take-up and acceptability of new interventions. Incorporation of interactions terms in the design and analysis of DCEs, explanations of risk, tests of external validity and incorporation of DCE results into a decision-making framework remain important areas for future research.},

@article{Bertini.2012,
 abstract = {The authors propose that a crowded product space motivates consumers to better discriminate between options of different quality. Specifically, this article reports evidence from three controlled experiments and one natural experiment that people are prepared to pay more for high-quality products and less for low-quality products when they are considered in the context of a dense, as opposed to a sparse, set of alternatives. To explain this effect, the authors argue that consumers uncertain about the importance of quality learn from observing market outcomes. Product proliferation reveals that other consumers care to discriminate among similar alternatives, and in turn, this inference raises the importance of quality in decision making.},

In this article we propose an integrative conceptualization of three important sources of reversed item method bias (acquiescence, careless responding, and confirmation bias) and specify a multisample confirmatory factor analysis model with 2 method factors to empirically test the hypothesized mechanisms, using explicit measures of acquiescence and carelessness and experimentally manipulated versions of a questionnaire that varies 3 item arrangements and the keying direction of the first item measuring the focal construct. We explain the mechanisms, review prior attempts to model reversed item bias, present our new model, and apply it to responses to a 4-item self-esteem scale (N = 306) and the 6-item Revised Life Orientation Test (N = 595). Based on the literature review and the empirical results, we formulate recommendations on how to use reversed items in questionnaires.},

pervasive confusion between ``theories of studies'' and studies of theories. Addressing these problems (``atoning for these sins'') would

@article{Ruyter.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Substituting sugar-free for sugar-sweetened beverages reduces weight gain. A possible explanation is that sugar-containing and sugar-free beverages cause the same degree of satiety. However, this has not been tested in long-term trials.

METHODS

We randomized 203 children aged 7-11 years to receive 250 mL per day of an artificially sweetened sugar-free beverage or a similarly looking and tasting sugar-sweetened beverage. We measured satiety on a 5-point scale by questionnaire at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. We calculated the change in satiety from before intake to 1 minute after intake and 15 minutes after intake. We then calculated the odds ratio that satiety increased by 1 point in the sugar-group versus the sugar-free group. We also investigated how much the children liked and wanted the beverages.

RESULTS

146 children or 72{\%} completed the study. We found no statistically significant difference in satiety between the sugar-free and sugar-sweetened group; the adjusted odds ratio for a 1 point increase in satiety in the sugar group versus the sugar-free group was 0.77 at 1 minute (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.29), and 1.44 at 15 minutes after intake (95{\%} CI, 0.86 to 2.40). The sugar-group liked and wanted their beverage slightly more than the sugar-free group, adjusted odds ratio 1.63 (95{\%} CI 1.05 to 2.54) and 1.65 (95{\%} CI 1.07 to 2.55), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS

Sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages produced similar satiety. Therefore when children are given sugar-free instead of sugar-containing drinks they might not make up the missing calories from other sources. This may explain our previous observation that children in the sugar-free group accumulated less body fat than those in the sugar group.

@article{Scarpi.2013,
 abstract = {Phantoms are dominating, attractive alternatives that are unavailable at the time of choice. They occupy different positions in the attribute space, and their unavailability can be either known or unknown to individuals. Although different theories have offered explanations for the influence that phantoms exert on individual choices, they have largely overlooked phantom knowledge. Contradictory predictions can be drawn from these theories, and none provides a good account of the pattern of effects that emerges from our data. We suggest that these contradictions appear because the different theories do not address phantom location and knowledge jointly. When considering phantom knowledge together with location, we observe a consistent overall pattern of effects that encompasses all predictions that could be made on the basis of each theory. We find that known phantoms are stronger when close, and favor the target product, whereas unknown phantoms are stronger when far, and favor the competitor. Finally, we look beyond shifts in choice shares and find that phantom decoys can also affect individuals' post-choice evaluations and reactions in terms of perceived justice, decision satisfaction, and repatronage intention. Our results show that post-choice evaluations are driven by phantom knowledge, not phantom location.},

comparison fluency (i.e., the overall ease of making that comparison). The task's LOA curve represents the range and concentration of potentially

acceptable comparisons, whereas comparison fluency refers to the salience and ease of making the comparison. We illustrate our approach using

previously studied problems (e.g., choice, variety seeking, the ``jacket and calculator'' problem, and contingent valuation) as well as new empirical tests},

While the literature has found that priming money has notable psychological consequences, little research has been done on the impact of priming money on consumer choice, particularly, their choice between hedonic and utilitarian options. The current research proposes that priming money will increase the likelihood of a prevention regulatory focus, and consequently, consumers will be more likely to choose more prudent alternatives when facing a trade-off between hedonic and utilitarian options. Results of four experiments show that participants in the money priming condition were more likely to choose utilitarian over hedonic options, compared with participants in the control condition. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by consumers' situational prevention focus on the exposure to money primes, but attenuated when credit cards are primed.},

This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general

explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature---similarity, attraction, and compromise effects---all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making.},

 abstract = {The current research examines the psychological process underlying the differential sensitivity to the compromise effect associated with a distinct self-regulatory focus. In particular, we test two competing hypotheses: one based on the different weights assigned to decision components, and the one that draws on biased perception. This issue is explored via the statistical derivation of decision weights (Study 1), manipulation of the temporal frame of choice (Study 2), and altering the risks associated with decision-making (Study 3). The results of these three studies consistently support the differential weight account: Promotion-focused participants assign greater weight to the desirability (or hedonic value) of the choice outcome, whereas prevention-focused participants place greater weight on the likelihood (or risk) of achieving that outcome. However, perceptions regarding the desirability and the risk of the given choice are similar among those with a distinct self-regulatory focus.},

@article{Senbabaoglu.2014,
 abstract = {Consensus clustering (CC) has been adopted for unsupervised class discovery in many genomic studies. It calculates how frequently two samples are grouped together in repeated clustering runs, and uses the resulting pairwise {\textquotedbl}consensus rates{\textquotedbl} for visual demonstration that clusters exist, for comparing cluster stability, and for estimating the optimal cluster number (K). However, the sensitivity and specificity of CC have not been systemically assessed. Through simulations we find that CC is able to divide randomly generated unimodal data into apparently stable clusters for a range of K, essentially reporting chance partitions of cluster-less data. For data with known structure, the common implementations of CC perform poorly in identifying the true K. These results suggest that CC should be applied and interpreted with caution. We found that a new metric based on CC, the proportion of ambiguously clustered pairs (PAC), infers K equally or more reliably than similar methods in simulated data with known K. Our overall approach involves the use of realistic null distributions based on the observed gene-gene correlation structure in a given study, and the implementation of PAC to more accurately estimate K. We discuss the strength of our approach in the context of other ensemble-based methods.},

The results indicate that a series of comparisons is made in each choice, with a pair of alternatives compared on a single attribute dimension in each comparison. We conclude that psychological models of choice should be based on these single-attribute pairwise comparisons.},

Our analyses revealed highly diverse entire colonization profiles, spread into 8 phyla/candidate divisions and in 15 different bacterial classes. A large inter-individual difference in the subjects' microbiota was observed, comprising 35{\%} of the total variance, but lacking conspicuous general temporal trends in both alpha and beta diversity. We further obtained strong evidence that subjects can be categorized into three clusters based on three differently occurring and mutually exclusive species clusters.},

@article{Li.2014,
 abstract = {Designed experiments provide product developers feedback on the relationship between formulation and consumer acceptability. While actionable, this approach typically assumes a simple psychophysical relationship between ingredient concentration and perceived intensity. This assumption may not be valid, especially in cases where perceptual interactions occur. Additional information can be gained by considering the liking-intensity function, as single ingredients can influence more than one perceptual attribute. Here, 20 coffee-flavored dairy beverages were formulated using a fractional mixture design that varied the amount of coffee extract, fluid milk, sucrose, and water. Overall liking (liking) was assessed by 388 consumers using an incomplete block design (4 out of 20 prototypes) to limit fatigue; all participants also rated the samples for intensity of coffee flavor (coffee), milk flavor (milk), sweetness (sweetness) and thickness (thickness). Across product means, the concentration variables explained 52{\%} of the variance in liking in main effects multiple regression. The amount of sucrose (beta = 0.46) and milk (beta = 0.46) contributed significantly to the model (p's {\textless}0.02) while coffee extract (beta = -0.17; p = 0.35) did not. A comparable model based on the perceived intensity explained 63{\%} of the variance in mean liking; sweetness (beta = 0.53) and milk (beta = 0.69) contributed significantly to the model (p's {\textless}0.04), while the influence of coffee flavor (beta = 0.48) was positive but marginally (p = 0.09). Since a strong linear relationship existed between coffee extract concentration and coffee flavor, this discrepancy between the two models was unexpected, and probably indicates that adding more coffee extract also adds a negative attribute, e.g. too much bitterness. In summary, modeling liking as a function of both perceived intensity and physical concentration provides a richer interpretation of consumer data.},

Consistent with this view, temporal, spatial, and social distances as well as hypotheticality are associated, affect each other, and are inferred from one another. Moreover, traversing all distances involves the use of abstraction, which we define as forming a belief about the substitutability for a specific purpose of subjectively distinct objects. Indeed, across many instances of both abstraction and psychological distancing, more abstract constructs are used for more distal objects. Here, we describe the implications of this relation for prediction, choice, communication, negotiation, and self-control. We ask whether traversing distance is a general mental ability and whether distance should replace expectancy in expected-utility theories.},

 abstract = {In virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety disorders, sense of presence in the virtual environment is considered the principal mechanism that enables anxiety to be felt. Existing studies on the relation between sense of presence and level of anxiety, however, have yielded mixed results on the correlation between the two. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed publications on VRET for anxiety that included self-reported presence and anxiety. The comprehensive search of the literature identified 33 publications with a total of 1196 participants. The correlation between self-reported sense of presence and anxiety was extracted and meta-analyzed. Potential moderators such as technology characteristics, sample characteristics including age, gender and clinical status, disorder characteristics and study design characteristics such as measurements were also examined. The random effects analysis showed a medium effect size for the correlation between sense of presence and anxiety (r = .28; 95{\%} CI: 0.18-0.38). Moderation analyses revealed that the effect size of the correlation differed across different anxiety disorders, with a large effect size for fear of animals (r = .50; 95{\%} CI: 0.30-0.66) and a no to small effect size for social anxiety disorder (r = .001; 95{\%} CI: -0.19-0.19). Further, the correlation between anxiety and presence was stronger in studies with participants who met criteria for an anxiety disorder than in studies with a non-clinical population. Trackers with six degrees of freedom and displays with a larger field of view resulted in higher effect sizes, compared to trackers with three degrees of freedom and displays with a smaller field of view. In addition, no difference in effect size was found for the type of presence measurement and the type of anxiety measurement. This meta-analysis confirms the positive relation between sense of presence and anxiety and demonstrates that this relation can be affected by various moderating factors.},

@article{Milberg.2014,
 abstract = {Purpose

-- The purpose of this paper is to extend the conclusions of a previous synthesis of attraction effect research (1995), focusing on the influence of background and design variables on the magnitude of the effect, and to identify additional factors that question the effect's practical market relevance.



Design/methodology/approach

-- Meta-analysis and moderator analysis (meta-regression) are used to summarize the findings and assess the explanatory power of background variables on the magnitude of the attraction effect.



Findings

-- Analyses indicate significant effects for procedure and the pre-entrant target percentage in addition to decoy type and decoy location found in previous synthesis. These factors explain 16 per cent of the variance. Previous findings that between-subject designs result in stronger attraction effects are not substantiated. Viable decoys led to a reversal of the attraction effect.



Research limitations/implications

-- This research contributes conceptually by demonstrating that the attraction effect is sensitive to research design factors which in some cases reverse the effect. This suggests that the underlying theory needs qualification and that generalizability may be limited. Given the constraints of meta-analysis, design factors that are idiosyncratic to a single study or are constant across studies could not be tested.



Practical implications

-- This research suggests that for the attraction effect to have practical relevance, knowledge of the effect needs updating because critical realities in the marketplace have been somewhat ignored by researchers in building theories regarding this effect.



Originality/value

-- By focusing on background variables that can moderate the magnitude of the attraction effect, the authors open a venue to expand the theoretical understanding and the practical relevance of the attraction effect in marketing.},

 abstract = {Decision-making under risk has been variably characterized and examined in many different disciplines. However, interdisciplinary integration has not been forthcoming. Classic theories of decision-making have not been amply revised in light of greater empirical data on actual patterns of decision-making behavior. Furthermore, the meta-theoretical framework of evolution by natural selection has been largely ignored in theories of decision-making under risk in the human behavioral sciences. In this review, I critically examine four of the most influential theories of decision-making from economics, psychology, and biology: expected utility theory, prospect theory, risk-sensitivity theory, and heuristic approaches. I focus especially on risk-sensitivity theory, which offers a framework for understanding decision-making under risk that explicitly involves evolutionary considerations. I also review robust empirical evidence for individual differences and environmental/situational factors that predict actual risky decision-making that any general theory must account for. Finally, I offer steps toward integrating various theoretical perspectives and empirical findings on risky decision-making.},

@article{Mottolese.2014,
 abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) and oxytocin (OXT) are two neuromodulators involved in human affect and sociality and in disorders like depression and autism. We asked whether these chemical messengers interact in the regulation of emotion-based behavior by administering OXT or placebo to 24 healthy subjects and mapping cerebral 5-HT system by using 2$\prime$-methoxyphenyl-(N-2$\prime$-pyridinyl)-p-[18F]fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine ([18F]MPPF), an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors. OXT increased [18F]MPPF nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the core area of 5-HT synthesis, and in the amygdala/hippocampal complex, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. Importantly, the amygdala appears central in the regulation of 5-HT by OXT: [18F]MPPF BPND changes in the DRN correlated with changes in right amygdala, which were in turn correlated with changes in hippocampus, insula, subgenual, and orbitofrontal cortex, a circuit implicated in the control of stress, mood, and social behaviors. OXT administration is known to inhibit amygdala activity and results in a decrease of anxiety, whereas high amygdala activity and 5-HT dysregulation have been associated with increased anxiety. The present study reveals a previously unidentified form of interaction between these two systems in the human brain, i.e., the role of OXT in the inhibitory regulation of 5-HT signaling, which could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for mental disorders.},

 abstract = {This research examines the roles of both approach--avoidance and approach--approach conflicts in the relationship between the degree of deliberation and persistence of preference for the chosen option. In three experiments, we reverse the negative effect of deliberation on persistence reported by Nordgren and Dijksterhuis (2009). In study 1A, we conceptually replicate Nordgren and Dijksterhuis's results in a choice context with simultaneous presentation of options. In study 1B, we reversed this effect by making minor alterations to the choice set. When the choice set contains a brand with advantage on an irrelevant attribute with conflict caused by the more important attributes remains unchanged, deliberation leads to greater preference stability. In study 2, we obtain process evidence for a reduction in conflict and dominance structuring caused by discrimination in terms of an irrelevant attribute. In study 3, we found that when choice set induces conflict between two attractive options, deliberation causes persistent preference. In study 4, we vary perceived conflict without varying the choice set and replicate the effects obtained in experiments 1A and 1B. Thus, our studies provide evidence for the roles of approach--avoidance and approach--approach conflicts (Coombs and Avrunin 1988) in the deliberation--persistence relationship.},

response categories (i.e., many scale points) systematically influences consumers' price sensitivity in a CBC (Choice Based Conjoint) study. We

suggest that this may occur because the narrow (vs. broad) response categories in the prior questions lead to consideration of a greater (vs. fewer)

to previous questions with narrow (vs. broad) response categories leads to a greater},

The three studies involved are conducted using between- and within-subjects experimental designs. Various product categories are used to generalize the findings. Study 1 looks at purchasing decisions and utilizes three scales of self-confidence, risk preference, and uncertainty; it demonstrates that consumers with high self-confidence are less likely to choose a compromise option due to high certainty in their decision-making. Study 2 discovers that people with low self-confidence are more likely to choose the middle option in a risky condition than in a nonrisky condition. Study 3 decomposes self-confidence into general and specific self-confidence, and reveals that people with low general self-confidence and low specific self-confidence are more likely to choose the middle option.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physician-rating websites (PRWs) are currently gaining in popularity because they increase transparency in the health care system. However, research on the characteristics and content of these portals remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesize published evidence in peer-reviewed journals regarding frequently discussed issues about PRWs. METHODS: Peer-reviewed English and German language literature was searched in seven databases (Medline (via PubMed), the Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete, ABI/Inform Complete, PsycInfo, Scopus, and ISI web of knowledge) without any time constraints. Additionally, reference lists of included studies were screened to assure completeness. The following eight previously defined questions were addressed: 1) What percentage of physicians has been rated? 2) What is the average number of ratings on PRWs? 3) Are there any differences among rated physicians related to socioeconomic status? 4) Are ratings more likely to be positive or negative? 5) What significance do patient narratives have? 6) How should physicians deal with PRWs? 7) What major shortcomings do PRWs have? 8) What recommendations can be made for further improvement of PRWs? RESULTS: Twenty-four articles published in peer-reviewed journals met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were published by US (n=13) and German (n=8) researchers; however, the focus differed considerably. The current usage of PRWs is still low but is increasing. International data show that 1 out of 6 physicians has been rated, and approximately 90{\%} of all ratings on PRWs were positive. Although often a concern, we could not find any evidence of {\textquotedbl}doctor-bashing{\textquotedbl}. Physicians should not ignore these websites, but rather, monitor the information available and use it for internal and ex-ternal purpose. Several shortcomings limit the significance of the results published on PRWs; some recommendations to address these limitations are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of publications is still low, PRWs are gaining more attention in research. But the current condition of PRWs is lacking. This is the case both in the United States and in Germany. Further research is necessary to increase the quality of the websites, especially from the patients' perspective.},

@article{Evangelidis.2013,
 abstract = {This article argues that the structure of a choice set can influence the extent to which consumers weight a given attribute. The results of seven experiments suggest that the relationship between options under consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which respondents evaluate options in the choice set. This article has theoretical implications for research on context effects, contingent decision behavior, and choice architecture as well as practical implications for product-line management.},

@article{Celedon.2013,
 abstract = {Consumer researchers show much interest in how the addition of products to a choice set changes the alignment of choice shares of existing products, specifically the attraction and superiority effects. Research in developed countries accounts for the vast majority of studies on these effects. Findings demonstrate that the attraction and superiority effects are robust when brand names are absent from product offerings. Testing whether these effects, with unbranded alternatives, will generalize to a different cultural context, in particular the Chilean market, is important. In addition, this paper extends prior research by further testing the generalizability of these effects in more realistic market scenarios that include brand alternatives. In the absence of brands, these effects generalize to the Chilean market; however, the inclusion of brands moderates these effects such that the results show no evidence of the attraction or superiority effects when the entrant's brand is more familiar than competitors' brands. The explanation for this observation is that consumers prefer more familiar brand alternatives even when these options are inferior with regard to product attribute trade-offs.},

@article{Bardach.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Our goal was to compare hospital scores from the most widely used commercial website in the USA to hospital scores from more systematic measures of patient experience and outcomes, and to assess what drives variation in the commercial website scores.

METHODS

For a national sample of US hospitals, we compared scores on Yelp.com, which aggregates website visitor ratings (1-5 stars), with traditional measures of hospital quality. We calculated correlations between hospital Yelp scores and the following: hospital percent high ratings (9 or 10, scale 0-10) on the 'Overall' item on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey; hospital individual HCAHPS domain scores (eg, nurse communication, pain control); hospital 30-day mortality; and hospital 30-day readmission rates.

RESULTS

Of hospitals reporting HCAHPS (n=3796), 962 (25{\%}) had scores on Yelp. Among hospitals with {\textgreater}5 Yelp ratings, the correlation of percent high ratings between Yelp and HCAHPS was 0.49 (p{\textless}0.001). The percent high ratings within each HCAHPS domain increased monotonically with increasing Yelp scores (p$\leq$0.001 for all domains). Percent high ratings in Yelp and HCAHPS were statistically significantly correlated with lower mortality for myocardial infarction (MI; -0.19 for Yelp and -0.13 for HCAHPS) and pneumonia (-0.14 and -0.18), and fewer readmissions for MI (-0.17 and -0.39), heart failure (-0.31 and -0.39), and pneumonia (-0.18 and -0.27).

CONCLUSIONS

These data suggest that rater experiences for Yelp and HCAHPS may be similar, and that consumers posting ratings on Yelp may observe aspects of care related to important patient outcomes.},

@article{BekkerGrob.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

A new modelling approach for analysing data from discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) has been recently developed in transport economics based on the notion of regret minimization-driven choice behaviour. This so-called Random Regret Minimization (RRM) approach forms an alternative to the dominant Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach. The RRM approach is able to model semi-compensatory choice behaviour and compromise effects, while being as parsimonious and formally tractable as the RUM approach.

OBJECTIVES

Our objectives were to introduce the RRM modelling approach to healthcare-related decisions, and to investigate its usefulness in this domain.

METHODS

Using data from DCEs aimed at determining valuations of attributes of osteoporosis drug treatments and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, we empirically compared RRM models, RUM models and Hybrid RUM-RRM models in terms of goodness of fit, parameter ratios and predicted choice probabilities.

RESULTS

In terms of model fit, the RRM model did not outperform the RUM model significantly in the case of the osteoporosis DCE data (p~=~0.21), whereas in the case of the HPV DCE data, the Hybrid RUM-RRM model outperformed the RUM model (p~{\textless}~0.05). Differences in predicted choice probabilities between RUM models and (Hybrid RUM-) RRM models were small. Derived parameter ratios did not differ significantly between model types, but trade-offs between attributes implied by the two models can vary substantially.

CONCLUSION

Differences in model fit between RUM, RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM were found to be small. Although our study did not show significant differences in parameter ratios, the RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM models did feature considerable differences in terms of the trade-offs implied by these ratios. In combination, our results suggest that RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM modelling approach hold the potential of offering new and policy-relevant insights for health researchers and policy makers.},

@article{Bouhlal.2013,
 abstract = {Decreasing dietary sodium intake, which can be achieved by reducing salt content in food, is recommended. Salt contributes to the taste of foods and makes them more enjoyable. Whether a food is liked or disliked is an important determinant of food intake, especially among children. However, the role of salt in children's food acceptance has received little attention. The impact of salt content on children's hedonic rating and intake of two foods was investigated in children. Using a within-subject crossover design, we recruited 75 children (8-11 years) to participate in five lunches in their school cafeteria. The target foods were green beans and pasta. The added salt content was 0, 0.6 or 1.2 g/100 g. The children's intake (g) of all lunch items was measured. The children provided their hedonic rating of the food, a preference ranking and a saltiness ranking in the laboratory. Children could rank the foods according to salt content, and they preferred the two saltier options. A food-specific effect of salt content on intake was observed. Compared to the intermediate level (0.6 g salt/100 g), not adding salt decreased green bean intake (-21{\%}; p = 0.002), and increasing the salt content increased pasta intake (+24{\%}; p{\textless}0.0001). Structural Equation Modeling was used to model the relative weights of the determinants of intake. It showed that the primary driver of food intake was the child's hunger; the second most important factor was the child's hedonic rating of the food, regardless of its salt content, and the last factor was the child's preference for the particular salt content of the food. In conclusion, salt content has a positive and food-specific effect on intake; it impacted food preferences and intake differently in children. Taking into account children's preferences for salt instead of their intake may lead to excessive added salt.},

@article{WatsonIVGeorgeF.,
 abstract = {Achieving customer loyalty is a primary marketing goal, but building loyalty and reaping its rewards remain ongoing challenges. Theory suggests that loyalty comprises attitudes and purchase behaviors that benefit one seller over competitors. Yet researchers examining loyalty adopt widely varying conceptual and operational approaches. The present investigation examines the consequences of this heterogeneity by empirically mapping current conceptual approaches using an item-level coding of extant loyalty research, then testing how operational and study-specific characteristics moderate the strategy $\rightarrow$ loyalty $\rightarrow$ performance process through meta-analytic techniques. The results clarify dissimilarities in loyalty building strategies, how loyalty differentially affects performance and word of mouth, and the consequences of study-specific characteristics. Prescriptive advice based on 163 studies of customer loyalty addresses three seemingly simple but very critical questions: What is customer loyalty? How is it measured? and What actually matters when it comes to customer loyalty?},
